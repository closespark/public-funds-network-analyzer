When individuals become dislocated workers because of job loss, mass layoffs, global trade dynamics or transitions in economic sectors, the WIOA DW program provides services to assist them in reentering the workforce.Activities to be performed: WIOA specifies that most DW services will be provided through the American Job Center network, also known as one-stop career centers. Under the DW program, eligible individuals will receive career services, which are classified into two categories: basic and individualized services. While some job seekers may only need self-service or other basic career services such as labor exchange services, others may need more comprehensive services, such as individualized services, which include career planning, and developing an individual employment plan outlining needs and goals of the job seeker. Participants will also receive training services linked to job opportunities in their communities. To promote customer choice and involvement in career decisions, participants use an Individual Training Account to select an appropriate training program from an eligible training provider list. WIOA also authorizes the provision of supportive services (e.g. transportation and child care assistance) to enable an individual to participate in the program.Expected Outcomes: The WIOA Dislocated Worker program outcomes are to ensure that individuals can access and receive the employment and training services they are eligible for, so that they may become employed or advance in employment. Grantees report performance measures of these outcomes, including the percentage of people employed in the second and fourth quarter after finishing.Intended beneficiaries: Individuals who lose their jobs because of layoffs, global trade dynamics, or other economic transitions, such individuals who have received a notice of termination or layoff from employment, including a separation notice from active military services. Specific eligibility criteria are provided in WIOA sec 3(15).Subrecipient Activities: The grantees may subaward funds from the DW program to provide individualized career services, training, as well as provide supportive services.",17.278: WIOA DISLOCATED WORKER FORMULA GRANTS,sub-grant,559DF3F8-FCCD-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2023,12,LWDA 9-23-05,859292.00,2023-11-06,2024,H1QHB3BCK665,074735515,COUNTY OF HENRICO,,,,,USA,United States,4301 E PARHAM RD,HENRICO,VA,VIRGINIA,232282745,VA-07,VA-04,,"U.S. LOCAL GOVERNMENT,COUNTY",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232232716.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,FY 2024 ADVANCE DW PY 2023,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_23A55AW000023_1601/,2023-12-20 00:00:00+00

We propose 3 specific aims. Aim 1 applies validated appropriateness criteria to a representative sample of the FORCE-TJR registry patients to classify them as either premature or appropriate but with 5 different levels of functional disability. Aim 2 appends this sample with geospatial information (SD) about their environment and determine the effect of the SD factors on TKR utilization. Aim 3 determine the effect of the SD factors on improvement after surgery. We examine the effect of SD factors related to (1) the medical care environment (i.e., access to and practice patterns of medical care) and (2) the built environment (i.e., all of the physical parts of where we live and work (e.g., homes, buildings, streets, open spaces, and infrastructure)). Our project will be the first to examine timing of TKR at a national level, and will provide new knowledge regarding the association of the medical care and built environments with timeliness of TKR utilization. Our findings will also inform clinical and public policy interventions aimed at targeting TKR to those who would benefit most from the procedure, and add to evidence that would support the proposition that improvements to the environment could lead to an overall reduction in disability pertaining to knee osteoarthritis.","93.846: ARTHRITIS, MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN DISEASES RESEARCH",sub-grant,C3ABBE3A-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,3,60058648 VCU,40973.00,2024-03-14,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,SOCIAL DETERMINANTS AND TIMELINESS OF TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT: A NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R01AR078342_075/,2024-03-15 00:00:00+00

The PM serves a defensive role within arthropods by protecting their midgut epithelia from abrasive food particles, regulating the movement of ingested toxins, and serving as a physical barrier against pathogen infection establishment. Some vector-borne protozoan pathogens, including mosquito-transmitted Plasmodium and sand fly-transmitted Leishmania, secrete chitinases that can degrade PM-associated chitin. However, tsetse fly-transmitted African trypanosomes do not produce chitinase, and the mechanism(s) these parasites use to circumvent tsetse’s PM are poorly understood.  In addition to potentially being infected with African trypanosomes, all tsetse flies harbor a taxonomically variable community of endosymbiotic bacteria. The success of trypanosome transmission through the tsetse vector depends in part on physiological interactions between the fly and these bacteria. One of tsetse’s endosymbionts, Sodalis glossinidius, exhibits a homogeneous distribution within all laboratory colonized flies and a heterogeneous distribution within and between wild fly populations. Several independent field and laboratory-based studies have repeatedly demonstrated a positive correlation between the presence and density of Sodalis in tsetse’s midgut and the ability of trypanosomes to successfully establish an infection in the fly. The mechanisms that underlie this correlation have never been determined. In this application our interdisciplinary research team will address the hypothesis that a Sodalis secreted endochitinase degrades the chitinous backbone of tsetse’s PM. We speculate that Sodalis-mediated degradation of PM-associated chitin facilitates trypanosome infection establishment in two ways. First, this process would compromise the structural integrity of the PM, thus making it easier for trypanosomes to cross. Second, chitin catabolism results in the production of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, which is a potent inhibitor of trypanocidal lectins. We propose to use Sodalis mutants that cannot produce endochitinase to functionally characterize the tripartite relationship between the bacterium, tsetse’s PM, and trypanosome infection establishment in the fly’s midgut. Additionally, we propose to use field captured tsetse flies to determine if their Sodalis produce endochitinase that mediates the structural integrity of their tsetse host’s PM. Completion of the experiments proposed in this application will increase our understanding of the basic physiological mechanisms that mediated trypanosome transmission through the tsetse vector and may have translational implications towards the development of novel disease control strategies. Additionally, knowledge obtained herein will be applicable to other arthropod vector model systems (e.g., mosquitoes, ticks, sandflies) that house midgut-associated bacteria and have a PM that pathogens must cross in order to be transmitted to a new vertebrate host.",93.855: ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES RESEARCH,sub-grant,CE321688-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,1,CON-80004074,35615.00,2023-12-12,2024,RL3YF9NM92A3,056915069,UNIVERSITY OF RICHMOND,,RL3YF9NM92A3,056915069,,USA,United States,110 UR DR,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,231730008,VA-07,VA-07,,"PRIVATE UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE,NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,231730008.0,VA-07,VA-90,USA,United States,"DR.

The purpose of this program is to introduce and prepare justice-involved youth and young adults for the world of work through placement into paid work experiences, and on a path to more equitable career opportunities with their peers.

Activities Performed
FHI 360's intermediary role will support thought leadership through documenting strategies and offering peer-to-peer learning through a community of practice and a toolkit of best practices. We will also bolster the local violence prevention efforts by hosting two Violence Prevention Situation Table Community of Practice meetings with our partner Operation 2 Save Lives and will certify five staff members as Trauma-informed Self-care Response trainers. These trainers will then train sub-grantees and up to 20 employers to enhance their ability to hire, supervise, and maintain young adults that have experienced trauma associated with poverty, community violence, crime, and incarceration.

Deliverables
100% enrollment of 350 participants, (WIOA indicators) participants will have 50% credential attainment rate, 70% measurable skill gains, median earnings of $5,750 or more 2nd quarter after exit, 70% education and employment rate 2nd quarter after exit, 60% education and employment rate 4th quarter after exit, and (REO-specific indicators) less than 5% arrested for a violent crime and less than 10% recidivism.

Intended Beneficiary
350 young adults between the ages of 18-24 who are impacted by crime, violence, and poverty

Subrecipient Activities
The GO! project sub-grantees will use growth-focused case management to guide participants towards their goals, while they are gaining leadership skills and are supported by mentors. Their justice partners will assist with recruitment and referrals, violence prevention partners will provide mentorship and training on conflict resolution skills, and employer partners will contribute to the design of occupational and job-readiness training and hire participants for paid-work experiences leading to unsubsidized employment.

The nuclear retinoid X receptor (RXR), shown to be diminished in human and mouse diabetic retinas, is of particular interest for therapeutic intervention due to its binding and activation of PPAR and LXR that regulate the expressions of lipid metabolism-associated and inflammation-related genes. Recently we synthesized two small molecules, the RXR agonists (rexinoids) UAB30 and UAB126 which demonstrated marked efficacy in reducing DR progression when given systemically; however these agents reduced hyperglycemia and thus the beneficial effect of rexinoids on DR could be directly due to improvement in diabetes management. In the proposed studies, we directed our efforts towards developing retinal delivery of rexinoids to remove the confounding effect on glucose regulation and establish whether this targeted delivery could beneficially impact retinal lipid metabolism and reduce retinal inflammation directly. Our overarching hypothesis is that intravitreal (IVT) delivery of rexinoids as sustainable released microparticles (UAB126-MP and UAB30-MP) will activate RXR, provide a long-term therapy for DR, and enhance the pool of RXR homodimers available to partner with the PPARs and LXRs to both prevent and reverse DR. Therefore, we propose that rexinoids act through the stabilization of the RXR/PPAR and RXR/LXR complexes leading to the normalization of lipid metabolism and correction of neurovascular defects typically seen in DR. We will test our hypothesis using IVT formulations of UAB126 and UAB30 and two diabetic mouse models, as well as ex vivo retinal models, primary human retinal microvascular endothelial and human retinal pigment epithelial cell cultures, and a diverse set of molecular biological applications. In Aim#1, we proposed to determine the physiological effect of RXR-based therapy in diabetic retinas by assessing the pharmacokinetics of UAB126- MP and UAB30-MP and the therapeutic impact of IVT rexinoids to prevent and reverse DR. In Aim#2, we will investigate the cellular mechanism of RXR-based therapy by examining the control of RXR on retinal lipid profile and reveal the retinal cell type most vulnerable to RXR deficiency in diabetes. In Aim#3, we will focus on molecular mechanisms of RXR-based therapy by investigating the requirement of PPAR and/or LXR as binding partners of RXR in the retina and the gene expression network regulated by PPAR and LXR responsive elements as consequences of IVT rexinoid delivery. This proposed study is highly innovative and has marked translational significance by targeting retinal lipotoxicity and retinal inflammation and could be tested not only as a monotherapy but also in combination with existing therapies for DR. Our interdisciplinary team has expertise in drug discovery, ocular drug delivery, cell biology, biochemistry, and metabolism of the diabetic retina and thus we have all the tools necessary to successfully accomplish this translational research.",93.867: VISION RESEARCH,sub-grant,C7A5FF50-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,10,000541470-SC001-XU,140111.00,2024-09-04,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980568.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,RXR-BASED THERAPY FOR DIABETIC RETINOPATHY,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R01EY035539_075/,2024-10-31 00:00:00+00

Early- stage breast cancer is traditionally treated with breast conserving surgery (BCS) followed by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and a 5- to10-year course of adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET). Long-term data from two randomized controlled trials demonstrate that omission of RT in older women with estrogen receptor positive, early-stage breast cancer who are treated with AET does not result in a decreased survival. However, over 70% of women still receive RT, due in part to physician and patient reluctance to omit a treatment in light of concerns about AET toxicity and adherence. Optimal choices for older breast cancer patients require considering data-based recommendations, life expectancy, co-morbidities and patient preferences. We will evaluate the use of pre-ET as a novel experiential tool to inform adjuvant therapy decisions, predict long-term AET adherence and to reduce decisional conflict and regret, addressing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To assess whether pre-ET changes patients’ and treating physicians’ preference for adjuvant RT. This test exposure will provide patients with the information they need to choose among the treatment options after BCS. We hypothesize that a 3-month course of pre-ET will reduce patients’ and physicians’ preferences for adjuvant RT by 10% from baseline preferences. We will also assess whether patient-reported outcomes during pre-ET predict AET adherence at 2 years. We will obtain exploratory data on tumor response to pre-ET by evaluating tumor proliferation indices before and after pre-ET. Aim 2: To measure the effect of pre-ET on decisional outcomes for adjuvant therapy after BCS. We will apply the Ottawa Decision Support Framework to evaluate the effects of a trial of endocrine therapy on decisional conflict and decisional regret, framing pre-ET as a decision support intervention. We will measure decisional regret at 1 and 2 years after BCS.

Early- stage breast cancer is traditionally treated with breast conserving surgery (BCS) followed by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and a 5- to10-year course of adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET). Long-term data from two randomized controlled trials demonstrate that omission of RT in older women with estrogen receptor positive, early-stage breast cancer who are treated with AET does not result in a decreased survival. However, over 70% of women still receive RT, due in part to physician and patient reluctance to omit a treatment in light of concerns about AET toxicity and adherence. Optimal choices for older breast cancer patients require considering data-based recommendations, life expectancy, co-morbidities and patient preferences. We will evaluate the use of pre-ET as a novel experiential tool to inform adjuvant therapy decisions, predict long-term AET adherence and to reduce decisional conflict and regret, addressing the following specific aims: Aim 1: To assess whether pre-ET changes patients’ and treating physicians’ preference for adjuvant RT. This test exposure will provide patients with the information they need to choose among the treatment options after BCS. We hypothesize that a 3-month course of pre-ET will reduce patients’ and physicians’ preferences for adjuvant RT by 10% from baseline preferences. We will also assess whether patient-reported outcomes during pre-ET predict AET adherence at 2 years. We will obtain exploratory data on tumor response to pre-ET by evaluating tumor proliferation indices before and after pre-ET. Aim 2: To measure the effect of pre-ET on decisional outcomes for adjuvant therapy after BCS. We will apply the Ottawa Decision Support Framework to evaluate the effects of a trial of endocrine therapy on decisional conflict and decisional regret, framing pre-ET as a decision support intervention. We will measure decisional regret at 1 and 2 years after BCS. We hypothesize that pre-ET will reduce decisional conflict and regret, and that decisional conflict and regret scores will be associated with 1- and 2-year adherence to AET. The use of pre-ET in the proposal represents a patient-centered treatment approach and may ultimately lead to a paradigm shift in the way that early-stage breast cancer is treated in older women, allowing for optimization assignment of adjuvant therapy, increased adherence to planned treatment regimens and decreased decisional regret.",93.395: CANCER TREATMENT RESEARCH,sub-grant,CE5815A4-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,11,GR102365.SUB00000821,30447.00,2024-11-11,2025,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980037,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,DR.

However, to achieve any of these goals, sharing of longitudinal developmental data from cohort studies and clinical trials is crucial.1,2  The purpose of this proposal for Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-22-261 Archiving and Documenting Child Health and Human Development Data Sets is to ensure that data from this three arm multi-site clinical trial of 85 very preterm infants, funded by NICHD prior to NIH’s guidelines for data sharing, is made available to research teams who could use it to address research questions beyond the initial study aims.3 Now is the time to fund the transition of this exciting data from a private dataset into a shared data set allowing the wealth of secondary analysis or harmonization with data set from other clinical trials which likely already include sharing plans. For example NICU trials including sensory intervention4, parenting5, and combined6 trials could be compared with the parent project. In addition, research teams focusing on understanding development are excited to use this data set and videos to answer questions on topics ranging from language acquisition to fine motor development.  Infants born preterm are at high risk of developmental delays with up to 20 percent of infants born very preterm diagnosed with cerebral palsy (CP) at 2 years of age. While the development of the Common Data Elements for CP (CDE_CP)7 have increased the rigor of individual studies, the use of these highly recommended outcomes also increases the likelihood of combining data sets. The parent project (R01 HD093624, NCT03518736) uses a combination of outcome measures from the CDE_CP which will enable harmonization with other data sets. In addition, the use of innovative outcomes that can be used to evaluate early problem-solving in infants and parent infant relationships starting in the NICU will allow for new and innovative developmental questions. Thus, researchers from a broad number of fields will benefit from sharing this data. The aims included in this proposal focus on what can be done with this data set alone. Aim 1) Provide an accessible dataset with longitudinal data on developmental measures including the recommended common data elements for CP (CDE_CP) and additional measures that are sensitive to change in children without CP. Since the 2017 publication of the International Guidelines for the Early and Accurate Detection of CP8, hospitals with NICUs around the world have been implementing the use of the General Movement Assessment (GMA) into research and practice. Public access to GMA videos from the NICU and at 10-14 weeks post term age combined with outcome data could drastically increase the ability to conduct research on the prognostic value of the GMA and the General Movement Observation Scale (GMOS) which many be more sensitive to change over time and can be scored from available GMA videos. The parent project includes GMA data at enrollment between 34-42 weeks of gestation, plus 1-2 videos at the most predictive age (10-14 weeks post term) and developmental outcomes at 12 and/or 24 months. Aim 2) Provide a shared data set with longitudinal assessment using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Exam (HINE) that can be used to determine if the HINE is sensitive to change over time. Innovative longitudinal intervention studies, such as the parent project, are beginning to evaluate interventions initiated in the first weeks of life with the goal of reducing the incidence and severity of developmental delays and cerebral palsy. The parent project uses the HINE as one component of determining if the child has CP. However, this prospective cohort is large enough to evaluate sensitivity to change over time using the HINE which has not been previously evaluated. Thus, is it crucial that data from research with young infants with or at high risk of having CP are publicly accessible to allow for secondary analysis such as tool validation. Aim 3) Publish high quality fidelity data which could be compared with other interventions started in the NICU or at 14 weeks of age. Rehabilitation interventions have a long history of NOT monitoring fidelity. This data set includes videos of 20% of the intervention visits which have been scored to measure adherence to the principles of the intervention. Other teams will be able to use the guidance included in the code book along with videos to improve their own fidelity evaluation or initiate comparative effectiveness study. Impact: PI Dusing is currently participating in the NICHD funded training program Reproresearch and is a member of the Databrary Launch Team, magnifying her previous interest in making this incredible data set available for public use. While epidemiolocal data can provide some insight into the needs or predictors of infant outcomes, primary longitudinally collected data is likely to be more clinically meaningful and more accurate. This data will contribute to a greater understanding of development and rehab for children.",93.865: CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH,sub-grant,CDBE5A9A-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,8,SCON-00006426,18823.00,2024-07-24,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"SHARING DEVELOPMENTAL, META, AND VIDEO DATA FROM PRETERM INFANTS ENROLLED IN THE SPEEDI CLINICAL TRIAL",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R03HD113705_075/,2024-08-20 00:00:00+00

It can be difficult to treat effectively, and the present approach is one-size-fits-all, trial-and-error, in large part because the etiology of OAB remains unclear. A substantive body of animal and ex vivo research implicates increased afferent activity and altered CNS processing of excitatory signals in OAB pathophysiology, contributing to bladder hypersensitivity. However, clinical characteristics that may reflect a bladder hypersensitivity state are poorly recognized and thus phenotyping OAB based on afferent pathophysiologic mechanisms, which would be crucial for individualized OAB care, has remained elusive. In response, we hypothesize that central sensitization (CS) is a pathophysiologic mechanism underlying OAB in certain individuals, which might explain the bladder hypersensitivity proposed in OAB. Findings from our preliminary work demonstrating elevated temporal summation to pain (i.e. primary marker for CS indexed with quantitative sensory testing, TSP) in female OAB patients appear to support this. Yet, we still know very little about how CS manifests in OAB, including how relevant it may be for men with OAB. Therefore, we now propose that CS not only contributes to bladder sensitivity, but also to psychosocial burdens, specifically increased negative affect (which is a frequent finding both individuals with CS-mediated conditions and OAB), which then impacts bladder symptoms. We will test this hypothesis with a sample of 200 men and women with OAB and 60 non-OAB controls, using a highly innovative, interdisciplinary approach. Aim 1 identifies phenotypic features characteristic of CS in OAB, including greater central sensory sensitivity, elevated psychosocial factors, co-morbidity with chronic pain conditions, and greater urinary symptoms. Because CS links to OAB have not previously been examined in men, we will test for sex differences in CS-related phenotypes. Aim 2 will directly test, for the first time, the effects of CS on bladder sensitivity in OAB. Aim 3 will examine whether CS moderates the day-to-day negative affective influences on OAB symptoms using a state-of-the-art ecological momentary assessment approach. When completed, we expect to be able to identify OAB individuals with a mechanism-based phenotype (CS-associated OAB) defined by signature mechanistic and phenotypic features for the first time. We anticipate that individuals with this CS- OAB association, likely because of the high psychosocial impact and CS-mediated hypersensitivity, will be more difficult to treat using standard OAB interventions (i.e. OAB medications) and may require multimodal or advanced therapy. This will be assessed with future intervention studies to measure individualized OAB treatment outcomes based on underlying CS mechanisms and determine causality of this OAB-CS association, which will help usher in an era of precision medicine to optimize care of men and women with OAB.","93.847: DIABETES, DIGESTIVE, AND KIDNEY DISEASES EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH",sub-grant,C6D1A8D6-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,9,96459,23821.00,2024-08-29,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849040,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,STRESS AND ANXIETY EFFECTS ON OVERACTIVE BLADDER: A CONTROLLED STUDY,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R01DK128293_075/,2024-09-23 00:00:00+00

It can be difficult to treat effectively, and the present approach is one-size-fits-all, trial-and-error, in large part because the etiology of OAB remains unclear. A substantive body of animal and ex vivo research implicates increased afferent activity and altered CNS processing of excitatory signals in OAB pathophysiology, contributing to bladder hypersensitivity. However, clinical characteristics that may reflect a bladder hypersensitivity state are poorly recognized and thus phenotyping OAB based on afferent pathophysiologic mechanisms, which would be crucial for individualized OAB care, has remained elusive. In response, we hypothesize that central sensitization (CS) is a pathophysiologic mechanism underlying OAB in certain individuals, which might explain the bladder hypersensitivity proposed in OAB. Findings from our preliminary work demonstrating elevated temporal summation to pain (i.e. primary marker for CS indexed with quantitative sensory testing, TSP) in female OAB patients appear to support this. Yet, we still know very little about how CS manifests in OAB, including how relevant it may be for men with OAB. Therefore, we now propose that CS not only contributes to bladder sensitivity, but also to psychosocial burdens, specifically increased negative affect (which is a frequent finding both individuals with CS-mediated conditions and OAB), which then impacts bladder symptoms. We will test this hypothesis with a sample of 200 men and women with OAB and 60 non-OAB controls, using a highly innovative, interdisciplinary approach. Aim 1 identifies phenotypic features characteristic of CS in OAB, including greater central sensory sensitivity, elevated psychosocial factors, co-morbidity with chronic pain conditions, and greater urinary symptoms. Because CS links to OAB have not previously been examined in men, we will test for sex differences in CS-related phenotypes. Aim 2 will directly test, for the first time, the effects of CS on bladder sensitivity in OAB. Aim 3 will examine whether CS moderates the day-to-day negative affective influences on OAB symptoms using a state-of-the-art ecological momentary assessment approach. When completed, we expect to be able to identify OAB individuals with a mechanism-based phenotype (CS-associated OAB) defined by signature mechanistic and phenotypic features for the first time. We anticipate that individuals with this CS- OAB association, likely because of the high psychosocial impact and CS-mediated hypersensitivity, will be more difficult to treat using standard OAB interventions (i.e. OAB medications) and may require multimodal or advanced therapy. This will be assessed with future intervention studies to measure individualized OAB treatment outcomes based on underlying CS mechanisms and determine causality of this OAB-CS association, which will help usher in an era of precision medicine to optimize care of men and women with OAB.","93.847: DIABETES, DIGESTIVE, AND KIDNEY DISEASES EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH",sub-grant,C6D1AE8A-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2023,11,96194,35776.00,2023-10-31,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,VUMC,,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849040.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,CENTRAL SENSITIZATION AND PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPACTS ON OVERACTIVE BLADDER,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R01DK128293_075/,2023-11-21 00:00:00+00

Substance use disorders affect millions of Americans, with substance use often beginning in adolescence. There is a pressing need to identify targets for interventions that reduce substance use initiation and misuse, especially for those at high risk. Our primary goal is to examine adolescent music engagement as a potential protective factor for early substance use behaviors. Music engagement is promising because of its many prosocial benefits, including for quality of life, social connectedness, and emotional competence. However, existing studies have not evaluated whether associations between music engagement and substance use are driven by correlated genetic or environmental influences versus direct causal effects. Beyond this, gene-by- environment interactions (GxE) are highly relevant to both music engagement and substance use, and music engagement may be especially protective for individuals at high genetic or environmental risk for substance use. Establishing these associations and understanding whether they are specific to music engagement and/or may be observed for other activities (e.g., art, sports engagement) will inform translational and intervention efforts aimed at preventing or reducing adolescent substance use before problematic use. We will conduct secondary data analyses of large longitudinal twin/family studies with multiple waves of assessment of music engagement, substance use, and genotyping on most subjects. Datasets include the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD) and the Colorado Adoption/Twin Study of Lifespan Behavioral Development and Cognitive Aging (CATSLife). Analyses include multiple twin/family and genomic approaches that inform whether associations are due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and causal effects (e.g., Mendelian Randomization Direction of Causation, Aim 1a), longitudinal analyses examining whether music engagement predicts later substance use behaviors (Aim 1b), and a detailed comparison of music engagement with other activities (Aim 1c). We will also test competing theoretical models of GxE (diathesis stress versus differential susceptibility) using polygenic scores (Aim 2a), environmental risk variables (e.g., SES, peer use, Aim 2b), and socio-demographic measures (Aim 2c). The study team is well-versed in longitudinal structural equation modeling approaches to study substance use and music engagement, including polygenic score and twin/family approaches leveraged here (and combinations of both). The research supported by this R01 award will be critical for understanding how music engagement relates to adolescent substance use initiation and progression, and to quantify the nature of these associations. It will lay groundwork for music intervention studies targeting individuals at highest risk for substance use problems (e.g., polygenic scores, environmental risk factors). This work responds directly to NIDA’s mission to identify factors leading to the prevention of substance use disorder and is directly relevant to the Music and Health initiative’s goal to examine how music engagement relates to important health traits such as substance use.",93.279: DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION RESEARCH PROGRAMS; 93.279: DRUG USE AND ADDICTION RESEARCH PROGRAMS; 93.310: TRANS-NIH RESEARCH SUPPORT,sub-grant,C5C8EBF2-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,11,1565753,203972.00,2024-10-07,2025,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"DR.

ASSOCIATED TUMOR STROMAL CELLS KNOWN AS COLLECTIVE INVASION OR MIGRATION. IN THESE TUMOR
CLUSTERS, NOT ALL CELLS ACT EQUALLY TO SUPPORT INVASION. SO-CALLED LEADER CELLS POLARIZE TO THE FRONT
OF THE PACK, DEFINE THE LEADING EDGE AND DRIVE DIRECTIONAL COLLECTIVE MIGRATION THROUGH PHYSICALLY
RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENTS. VARIOUS FACTORS WITHIN THE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT ARE KNOWN TO
CONTRIBUTE TO LEADER CELL DRIVEN COLLECTIVE MIGRATION, HOWEVER THE IMPACT OF CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL
SIGNAL HETEROGENEITY HAS NOT, YET IS ALSO CRITICAL TO REGULATION OF TUMOR INVASION AND METASTASIS.
THUS, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO INVESTIGATE MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE
TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT THAT COULD INFLUENCE DIRECTIONAL COLLECTIVE TUMOR MIGRATION. WE WILL USE
AN INTEGRATED APPROACH THAT COMBINES 3D MICROFLUIDIC BIOENGINEERING, BIOMECHANICAL
ENGINEERING, MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR CANCER BIOLOGY WITH COMPUTATIONAL SIMULATIONS OF 3D TUMOR
COLLECTIVE MIGRATION TO ACCOMPLISH THE OBJECTIVE.
THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PROJECT ARE:
SPECIFIC AIM 1: TO DETERMINE HOW K14 LEADER CELLS WITHIN PRIMARY BREAST TUMOR ORGANOIDS
POLARIZE TO THE LEADING EDGE AND THEN FUNCTION TO DIRECT COLLECTIVE MIGRATION
SPECIFIC AIM 2: TO UNDERSTAND CHEMO-MECHANICAL FEEDBACK BETWEEN CAF-BASED ECM
REMODELING AND LEADER-BASED INVASION.
THE ROLE OF MY LAB WILL BE TO DESIGN, DEVELOP, AND SYNTHESIZE THE 3D MICROFLUIDIC LAB-ON-A-CHIP
MODEL SYSTEM WHERE WE CAN MODULATE CHEMICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND PERFORM
MECHANISTIC STUDIES TO ANSWER OUR OBJECTIVES. THE MODEL SYSTEM WILL BE USED IN SPECIFIC AIMS 1
AND 2. WE WILL USE OUR LAB-ON-A-CHIP MODEL SYSTEM TO PERFORM RELEVANT LIVE-CELL IMAGING STUDIES
AND ASSOCIATED ANALYSIS USING VARIOUS BREAST TUMOR MODELS, INCLUDING MOUSE AND HUMAN

Issues around sexuality may have wide-ranging repercussions, from mental health problems to damaged interpersonal relationships, psychological distress, risky behaviors, to violence. Despite this, we still know little about which factors determine SW, and how to measure it. Existing self-report scales are either designed to be brief, only suitable for certain groups, and/or focus mostly on sexual functioning and the absence of negative factors such as coercion or sexually-transmitted infections. While this is important, it is not sufficient for optimal sexual health, which is “a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being related to sexuality;[...]not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity” (WHO, 2006). Optimal SW may also encompass positive factors, such as feeling loved by one's partner, the ability to enjoy pleasurable experiences, and self- acceptance. Challenges in measuring SW hinders the research process, making informed decisions on sexuality education, and the development of impactful interventions. Here we address these gaps by developing a comprehensive model and in-depth scale of SW which includes positive, strength-based aspects of sexuality. Our team includes experts in sexuality, public health, psychology, and measurement scale development. We will use a proven, highly rigorous three-phase methodology over a five year project timeline. In phase one, we will identify all potential dimensions of SW by applying surveys, analyzing focus groups, conducting interviews, literature review, and more. Phase two focuses on validation of the identified dimensions and development of a robust SW measurement scale. We will first generate a pool of questionnaire items that cover all candidate dimensions and then use interviews, expert feedback, and pilot studies to refine them. Subsequently, we will conduct large-scale studies with thousands of participants to establish the scale's dimensionality using factor analysis, and will test scale validity across different subgroups of our samples. In the final phase, we will assess the value of the resulting SW scale for research and public health by administering it to 3000 participants in a U.S. nationally representative probability sample. We will examine how SW dimensions vary with age, gender, and other demographic variables, as well as associations with health and well-being. Participants will also rate the importance of each dimension, as individuals differ vastly in what they care about in sexuality. We will test whether incorporating importance ratings into scale item weights improve its ability to predict health outcomes. Ultimately, our research will deliver a robust SW scale with demonstrable value for predicting health outcomes, thereby laying a robust foundation for future investigations, clinical applications, and interventions.",93.865: CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH,sub-grant,C98E5E52-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2025,1,501237,56121.00,2024-12-09,2025,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,CLINICAL PRACTICES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980568.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"IN YEAR 1 (2024-2025), DR.

The COVID-19 pandemic and significant policy shifts are causing major transformations in how people with IDD live in their communities, the supports that are available to them, and the personal outcomes they experience as a result. In the context of such dramatic societal and policy changes, it is essential for states to be able to use the best available data In order to design their systems of service and supports, and for advocates to have access to rigorous yet understandable information to inform their work to demand supports for inclusive life in the community. The proposed research project aims to help state policymakers and advocates get the information they need to make data-informed decisions that will ultimately lead to the development of services and supports that respond to the needs of people with IDD in these changing times. This research is based on the merger of four major datasets, each of which provides unique and important insight into the relationship between Medicaid utilization, a person?s support needs, and personal and system-level outcomes for people with IDD. Medicaid is the single largest funder for services and supports for people with IDD and the first two data sources we will work with represent Virginia?s Medicaid system: (a) Medicaid Home and Community Based Services expenditure data, which includes services that help people with IDD live in their communities and (b) Medicaid Managed Care acute medical encounter data, which shows the medical services a person with IDD has used, including those related to COVID-19. The third data set is the National Core Indicators In Person Survey (NCI-IPS), which is used in the majority of states to assess IDD system performance as well as personal outcomes for people with IDD. Finally, the fourth data source is the Supports Intensity Scale, which is a standa rdized instrument for assessing the support needs of people with IDD across several distinct domains. We will merge data from these four sources at the individual level from Virginia fiscal years 2019, 20, and 21, to create one of the country?s most comprehensive IDD-focused datasets. When combined with our previously merged datasets from 2017 and 2018, we will be able to perform in-depth longitudinal analyses that will enable us to understand the effects of COVID-19 and major state and federal policy initiatives on the lives of people with IDD and on Virginia?s service system as a whole.The ultimate aim of this project is to not only inform state IDD system administrators and advocates in Virginia, but to provide a blueprint for other states to follow to gain better insight into how their own Medicaid services translate to outcomes. As such, we are committed to making not only our findings, but also our processes and code, available to stakeholders in other states.

Pain is one of the major comorbidities of SCD leading to poor quality of life, frequent opioid use and reduced survival. Compared to most other painful conditions, pain in SCD is unique because of the unpredictable and recurrent episodes of acute pain due to vaso-occlusive crises, in addition to chronic pain which continuously affects the majority of individuals. Pain in SCD can start during infancy and continue throughout life. Guided by an unmet need to address the morbidity associated with pain in SCD, our network is committed to profoundly impacting the science of sickle cell pain through leading expertise in pain, SCD pathobiology, end-organ damage and integrative interventions, assisted by cutting-edge technological advancement through 3 specific aims: [#1] “Science without borders.” To develop a collaborative network of multidisciplinary scientists, clinicians, analysts, and community partners to advance the understanding of SCD pain mechanisms; [#2] “Promoting the future” for innovative, technically advanced, multidimensional, multidisciplinary and holistic team science approaches; and [#3] “Hub to health,” multimodal dissemination efforts to maximize access to SCDPAIN. To achieve these goals, we will establish 6 focused working groups on, priority areas, pilot funding, sabbatical review, network foresight and review, annual review, and promotion of diversity and equity. We propose 3 critical priority areas, [i] to determine the central mechanisms involved in the persistence of pain and opioid use in SCD, [ii] study “interoception of sickle pain perception” and/or improve SCD pain responses in the brain and other organs within animals and humans, and [iii] examine chronic and acute pain and downstream complications and treatment side-effects requiring whole-person approaches. Finally, we will maximize access to SCDPAIN via multimodal dissemination efforts to propel scientific advancements in SCD. The MPI team has extensive experience in propelling SCD pain research forward, bringing multidisciplinary teams together, and mentoring the next generation of pain scientists. In addition, a team of 9 collaborators bring extensive, diverse and cutting-edge technology which will lead research into a new era of mechanism-based translational understanding of sickle cell pain. Their passion for successful mentoring and promoting diversity is poised to provide a continuum of success to the network. The impact of SCDPAIN will be monumental in: [1] Building multidisciplinary research capacity to fulfill critical unmet needs of SCD pain; [2] Incentivizing novel initiatives through Pilot funds leading to R-series, HEAL and related Grants and [3] Catalyzing the future generation of scientists to accelerate SCD pain research. SCDPAIN will lead to a transformative framework and excite experts and novice researchers for mechanism- based, whole-person understanding of SCD pain mechanisms.",93.213: RESEARCH AND TRAINING IN COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH,sub-grant,28F1A994-FCD2-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,12,2024-2268-1,37491.00,2024-10-22,2025,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849040,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"DELIVERABLES:

Medications for OUD (MOUDs) such as buprenorphine and methadone are the frontline treatment for OUD, yet over half of individuals who initiate MOUD relapse or leave treatment in the first year, highlighting the importance of adjunctive therapies that might improve OUD treatment outcomes. Insomnia is a common and often recalcitrant issue among persons on MOUDs but there is little guidance on how to ameliorate symptoms of insomnia during OUD treatment. The orexin (or hypocretin) neurotransmitter system plays a role in insomnia and in the onset, progression, and maintenance of OUD. Suvorexant is a dual-orexin receptor antagonists that is FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia, and data from our group suggests that suvorexant might be especially efficacious in treating insomnia in persons with OUD and may also confer collateral benefits including decreased opioid craving and symptoms of withdrawal. Moreover, suvorexant has an excellent safety profile and did not result in increased adverse events or measures of abuse potential when compared to placebo in our pilot study. The proposed study is an FDA-regulatory-grade Phase III multisite randomized-controlled trial of suvorexant versus placebo in persons with insomnia who are utilizing long-term MOUD treatment. Participants who are prescribed buprenorphine or methadone for OUD will be screened to determine study eligibility. Eligible individuals will be enrolled for an 8-week study that includes the following conditions: one night double-dummy placebo lead-in prior to randomization; ~8 weeks of suvorexant or placebo where the dose may be escalated from 10 mg to 20 mg after 3 nights (consistent with current suvorexant label instructions); and two-nights double-dummy placebo lead-out to examine discontinuation effects. In lab polysomnography (PSG) will be used to at the beginning and end of the trial to determine the primary endpoint of change from baseline total sleep time. Adverse events and other indicators of patient safety will be monitored throughout the study. Participants will also be assessed for OUD treatment outcomes including regular urine toxicology and trajectories of mental health during the study. Specific Aims of the study are to (Aim 1) evaluate the efficacy of suvorexant versus placebo in treat insomnia in persons taking buprenorphine or methadone for OUD treatment, (Aim1) Evaluate the safety of suvorexant versus placebo in persons taking buprenorphine or methadone for OUD treatment, (Aim 3) submit a Supplement Application of Efficacy to the FDA to support an update to the label of suvorexant, and (Exploratory Aim 4) determine whether suvorexant versus placebo improves OUD treatment outcomes. The results of this important study will inform treatment providers on whether suvorexant is safe and effective for insomnia in persons with OUD, and exploratory results will further our scientific understanding of the role of the orexin system in OUD treatment and recovery.",93.279: DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION RESEARCH PROGRAMS; 93.279: DRUG USE AND ADDICTION RESEARCH PROGRAMS,sub-grant,213CAA8C-FCD2-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,12,2006508541,320286.00,2024-10-16,2025,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"PHASE III DOUBLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF SUVOREXANT VERSUS...",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_U01DA060708_075/,2024-12-03 00:00:00+00

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) makes grants annually to cities that are the most populous unit of general local government in metropolitan statistical areas with more than 500,000 people and at least 2,000 HIV/AIDS cases and States with more than 2,000 HIV/AIDS cases outside of eligible metropolitan statistical areas. The main purpose of HOPWA formula funding is to provide housing assistance, supportive services, program planning, and development costs. Current HOPWA formula allocations by grantee are available here: https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/budget; Activities to be Performed: HOPWA formula awards are contingent upon the submission and approval by HUD of a jurisdiction's Consolidated Plan and Annual Action Plan. Grantees must identify the eligible HOPWA activities at 24 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 574.300 that will be implemented with grant funding in the jurisdiction’s Consolidated Plan and Annual Action Plan. Housing assistance can be provided in the form of permanent housing which includes tenant-based (scattered site) and facility-based (subsidized payment on a specific building, unit, or project) rental assistance, or through transitional or short-term housing assistance.; Expected Outcomes: HOPWA program activities focus on establishing stable housing, reducing risk of homelessness, and improving access to healthcare and supportive services. HOPWA formula grantees are required to submit annual performance reports on grant expenditures, activities undertaken, program accomplishments, and household outcomes related to housing stability; homelessness prevention, and access to care and support. HOPWA formula program grantees must annually submit reporting form HUD-4155: Consolidated Annual Progress Report and Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report to HUD 90 days after the end of each program or operating year. HOPWA Performance Profiles are generated quarterly for all agencies receiving HOPWA grants, and are accessible here: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hopwa/hopwa-performance-profiles/ ; Intended Beneficiaries: Eligibility for HOPWA is limited to individuals and families who have: (1) at least one person with an HIV diagnosis. This includes families where the only eligible person is a minor. Medical verification of status is required; and 2) a total household income that does not exceed 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI), as defined by HUD. A person with HIV or a family member regardless of income is eligible to receive HOPWA housing information services. Any person living in proximity to a community residence is eligible to participate in that residence's community outreach and educational activities regarding HIV/AIDS.; Subrecipient Activities: The subrecipient activities are unknown at the time of award.",14.241: HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONS WITH AIDS,sub-grant,49AE71D0-FCD2-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2025,1,FY25HOPWA-03,1203530.00,2024-07-22,2024,N8FPY1QNSGJ6,057876781,COMMONWEALTH CATHOLIC CHARITIES,RICHMOND FLYING SQUIRRELS,,,,USA,United States,1601 ROLLING HILLS DR,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232295011,VA-07,VA-01,,NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232295007.0,VA-07,VA-01,USA,United States,"CCC PROVIDES HOUSING AND SUPPORT SERVICES TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) makes grants annually to cities that are the most populous unit of general local government in metropolitan statistical areas with more than 500,000 people and at least 2,000 HIV/AIDS cases and States with more than 2,000 HIV/AIDS cases outside of eligible metropolitan statistical areas. The main purpose of HOPWA formula funding is to provide housing assistance, supportive services, program planning, and development costs. Current HOPWA formula allocations by grantee are available here: https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/comm_planning/budget; Activities to be Performed: HOPWA formula awards are contingent upon the submission and approval by HUD of a jurisdiction's Consolidated Plan and Annual Action Plan. Grantees must identify the eligible HOPWA activities at 24 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 574.300 that will be implemented with grant funding in the jurisdiction’s Consolidated Plan and Annual Action Plan. Housing assistance can be provided in the form of permanent housing which includes tenant-based (scattered site) and facility-based (subsidized payment on a specific building, unit, or project) rental assistance, or through transitional or short-term housing assistance.; Expected Outcomes: HOPWA program activities focus on establishing stable housing, reducing risk of homelessness, and improving access to healthcare and supportive services. HOPWA formula grantees are required to submit annual performance reports on grant expenditures, activities undertaken, program accomplishments, and household outcomes related to housing stability; homelessness prevention, and access to care and support. HOPWA formula program grantees must annually submit reporting form HUD-4155: Consolidated Annual Progress Report and Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report to HUD 90 days after the end of each program or operating year. HOPWA Performance Profiles are generated quarterly for all agencies receiving HOPWA grants, and are accessible here: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hopwa/hopwa-performance-profiles/ ; Intended Beneficiaries: Eligibility for HOPWA is limited to individuals and families who have: (1) at least one person with an HIV diagnosis. This includes families where the only eligible person is a minor. Medical verification of status is required; and 2) a total household income that does not exceed 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI), as defined by HUD. A person with HIV or a family member regardless of income is eligible to receive HOPWA housing information services. Any person living in proximity to a community residence is eligible to participate in that residence's community outreach and educational activities regarding HIV/AIDS.; Subrecipient Activities: The subrecipient activities are unknown at the time of award.",14.241: HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONS WITH AIDS,sub-grant,49AE79D2-FCD2-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2025,1,FY25HOPWA-05,350000.00,2024-07-22,2024,J9M9ZJWB88M5,790886121,SUPPORTWORKS HOUSING,RICHMOND FLYING SQUIRRELS,,,,USA,United States,1900 COOL LN STE B,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232233912,VA-03,VA-04,,NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232233912.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"SUPPORTWORKS HOUSING PROVIDES HOPWA-SPECIFIC SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS IN OUR PROPERTIES (NEW CLAY, STUDIOS AT SOUTH RICHMOND, JAMES RIVER APARTMENTS, COOL LANE COMMONS) AS WELL AS PROVIDE OPERATING SUPPORT TO THE STRATFORD HOUSE COMMUNITY-LIVING PROPERTY FOR RESIDENTS WITH A POSITIVE HIV/AIDS DIAGNOSIS.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_VAH24F001_086/,2025-01-13 00:00:00+00

Last year, there were 26,363 opioid related emergencies in Virginia alone. Along with staggering opioid overdose numbers, the use of stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine is rising at alarming rates as well. Positively, though, the grant year 2021-2022 saw almost 6,500 individuals receiving SUD treatment services; nearly 38,000 benefitted from peer recovery services and public information prevention campaigns reached over 30-million Virginians, all thanks to State Opioid Response funding from SAMHSA. The SOR grant is saving and transforming lives, especially those of marginalized population members such as LGBTQIA, veterans, older adults, pregnant and parenting women and justice involved individuals. This application details another two years of comprehensive prevention, treatment and recovery services. This programming will be implemented through coalitions, OBATS, free health clinics, mobile treatment centers, jails and prisons, universities, hospitals, recovery residences, community organizations and harm reduction facilities, as well as statewide distribution of naloxone.

Last year, there were 26,363 opioid related emergencies in Virginia alone. Along with staggering opioid overdose numbers, the use of stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine is rising at alarming rates as well. Positively, though, the grant year 2021-2022 saw almost 6,500 individuals receiving SUD treatment services; nearly 38,000 benefitted from peer recovery services and public information prevention campaigns reached over 30-million Virginians, all thanks to State Opioid Response funding from SAMHSA. The SOR grant is saving and transforming lives, especially those of marginalized population members such as LGBTQIA, veterans, older adults, pregnant and parenting women and justice involved individuals. This application details another two years of comprehensive prevention, treatment and recovery services. This programming will be implemented through coalitions, OBATS, free health clinics, mobile treatment centers, jails and prisons, universities, hospitals, recovery residences, community organizations and harm reduction facilities, as well as statewide distribution of naloxone.

Pain is the clinical hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD), yet pain management remains inadequate for many in this population due to lack of evidence-based pain treatment approaches for SCD, and due to stigma and implicit bias in the healthcare system. Black adolescents and young adults (AYAs, ages 16-30) with SCD are particularly vulnerable as they endure repeat hospitalizations due to pain crises while coping with stigma and related stressors, as well as the other challenges of transitioning to adulthood. Opioids are the primary agent used in chronic SCD pain management, despite evidence that they provide poor long-term relief and lead to negative physical and psychological consequences. Psychosocial interventions that teach cognitive and behavioral strategies can simultaneously reduce pain and stigma and enhance mood in patients with SCD. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the primary behavioral health approach to managing pain in the general population, and digital CBT has expanded its accessibility. In SCD and other minority populations, we have demonstrated that a low-cost, scalable, technology-delivered version of CBT is feasible and can be effective for addressing stress and pain. We have learned that personalized support can improve engagement with digital CBT. We will now test a personalized approach customized for AYAs with SCD using peer support delivered through community-based organizations (CBOs). We will conduct a multisite, randomized controlled trial of digital CBT to understand the level of support needed to achieve benefits for reducing pain and stigma. Our Peer suppoRt for adolescents and Emerging adults with Sickle cell pain: promoting ENgagement in Cognitive behavioral thErapy (PRESENCE) study aims to reduce pain, opioid use, and healthcare utilization among AYAs with SCD. During the UG3 phase, we will leverage an established infrastructure for delivering virtual peer support interventions, existing digital CBT programs tailored by and for people with SCD, and partnerships with CBOs to jointly refine the study design, digital CBT content, and peer support component and work with the HEAL ERN CCC and DCC to prepare for the UH3 trial. After meeting UG3 milestones and transitioning to the UH3 phase, we will randomize 470 AYAs with frequent pain (³4 days/wk) over the past ³3 months to one of 3 treatment groups: 1) a digital CBT program with weekly one-on-one peer support provided via text and/or telephone based on participant preference (CBT+peer), 2) the same digital CBT program without peer support (self-guided CBT), or 3) usual care (UC). We first hypothesize that AYAs receiving either digital CBT treatment (CBT+ peer or self-guided CBT) will have better pain and mental health outcomes than AYAs receiving UC at 6 months. Second, we hypothesize that CBT+peer will be associated with improved program engagement and pain and mental health outcomes at 6 months compared with self-guided CBT. The PRESENCE trial will determine effectiveness of digital CBT for pain management among AYAs with SCD, a critical step toward future wide-scale deployment as part of routine SCD care.",93.279: DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION RESEARCH PROGRAMS; 93.837: CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES RESEARCH,sub-grant,359803C8-FCD2-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,4,139537-3,30018.00,2024-02-22,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980568,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,PEER SUPPORT FOR ADOLESCENTS AND EMERGING ADULTS WITH SICKLE CELL PAIN: PROMOTING ENGAGEMENT IN COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_UG3HL165839_075/,2024-04-02 00:00:00+00

The National Coastal Zone Management Program, under the Coastal Zone Management Act, is an important voluntary federal-state partnership that protects, restores, and responsibly develops our nations coastal communities and resources by balancing economic development, coastal uses, and natural resource protection. NOAAs investment of over $3.1M is leveraging $2.6M in state and local funds.  These funds will support jobs and provide continued assistance to the Virginia coastal management program to address many important coastal issues in the state including coastal hazards and resilience, habitat restoration and protection, ocean planning, and stewardship programs and activities. The funding also supports ongoing coastal community planning, marine debris reduction, wetland and shoreline mapping and permitting, beach and dunes protection, water quality management, and public outreach and education.  The award also is supporting the following new initiatives:  An assessment of public financing options in support of coastal dredging and resilience activities in rural jurisdictions.   Expansion of technical assistance and training for resilience planning, including use of the Resilience Adaptation Feasibility Tool in the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission and continued support for the Community Rating System across many localities to reduce insurance premiums.  Characterization and mapping of aggregate resources for purposes of contributions to resilience-related infrastructure projects such as the raising of critical roadways in the face of sea level rise and flooding.  Development of a draft Virginia Ocean Plan to guide decision-making in ways that balance emerging economic ocean uses with conservation of coastal resources and preservation of traditional uses.  The award also supports all Virginia coastal communities through resilience-focused coordination, planning, and technical assistance offered by the eight coastal Planning District Commissions to local government units in the Commonwealth. This effort continues the successful advancement of community best practices consistent with direction from the Virginia coastal resilience master plan. Work will include identifying regional resilience priorities, effective stakeholder and public engagement, technical assistance, geospatial analyses, and updates to a statewide resilience database capturing projects and best practices.",11.419: COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION AWARDS,sub-grant,9776226A-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,12,NA24NOSX419C0026 92.01,40000.00,2024-11-26,2025,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"CENTURIES OF OVERFISHING, HABITAT ALTERATION AND POLLUTION HAVE ERADICATED ATLANTIC STURGEON FROM MANY CHESAPEAKE BAY TRIBUTARIES. THE SPECIES IS NOW LISTED AS FEDERALLY ENDANGERED THROUGH MOST OF ITS HISTORIC RANGE. IN VIRGINIA, SMALL BUT VIABLE POPULATIONS OF ATLANTIC STURGEON PERSIST IN SEVERAL RIVERS AND THE VIRGINIA MARINE RESOURCES COMMISSION (VMRC), VCU RICE RIVERS CENTER (RRC), NOAA FISHERIES, AND OTHER PARTNERS ARE DEDICATED TO CONSERVING AND REBUILDING ATLANTIC STURGEON POPULATIONS ALONG THE EAST COAST. 
VMRC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SUSTAINABLY MANAGING COMMERCIAL FISHERIES IN VIRGINIA WATERS.  VMRC WILL SOON NEED TO MAKE FISHERY MANAGEMENT DECISIONS INFORMED BY RULES PROPOSED BY NOAA NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE (NMFS) TO REDUCE BY-CATCH MORTALITY TO PROTECT STURGEON. THOSE RULES COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE GILLNET FISHERY IN VA. AT THE FEBRUARY 2024 MID-ATLANTIC FISHERIES MANAGEMENT COUNCIL (MAFMC) MEETING, SEVERAL PACKAGES OF ALTERNATIVES WERE REVIEWED FOR THEIR STURGEON BYCATCH REDUCTION POTENTIALS AND FISHERY IMPACTS. THE MAFMC DETAILED POTENTIAL AREA AND TIME RESTRICTIONS FOR THE ALTERNATIVES AND ALSO INCLUDED POTENTIAL FISHERY CLOSURES IN AREAS AND TIMES OF HIGHER OBSERVED STURGEON BYCATCH. THE COUNCILS ARE SCHEDULED TO TAKE FINAL ACTION AT THEIR RESPECTIVE APRIL 2024 MEETINGS.  WHILE THE PROPOSED ALTERNATIVES WILL LIKELY RESULT IN REDUCED BYCATCH OF ATLANTIC STURGEON, IT WILL ALSO IMPACT COMMERCIAL FISHERIES IN VIRGINIA WATERS AND THESE REGIONAL ALTERNATIVES ARE NOT NECESSARILY TAILORED TO VIRGINIA HABITAT AND FISHERIES. 
THE VMRC SEEKS TO INCREASE AVAILABLE OPTIONS FOR REDUCING BYCATCH OF ATLANTIC STURGEON BASED ON DATA THAT IS SPECIFIC TO HABITAT AND FISHERIES IN VIRGINIA WATERS. THIS IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING BOTH A VIBRANT COMMERCIAL FISHING INDUSTRY AND PROTECTION OF CRITICAL RESOURCES.  TO DO SO, VMRC WILL NEED TO APPLY FOR A SECTION 10 PERMIT FOR THE INCIDENTAL TAKING OF ENDANGERED AND THREATENED SPECIES (ITP), UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT SECTION 10(A)(1)(B). HOWEVER, THIS APPLICATION PROCESS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT DATA DEVELOPMENT AND ANALYSIS AND REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HABITAT CONSERVATION PLAN (HCP), AND VMRC WILL REQUIRE SUPPORT DUE TO LIMITED AGENCY STAFF AND RESOURCES. A HCP IS REQUIRED FOR AN ITP APPLICATION, AND SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS ARE DESCRIBED ON THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE FACT SHEET.
NOTE THAT THIS TASK WILL RELY ON EXISTING AND MODELED DATA AND DOES NOT INCLUDE FUNDING FOR FIELD WORK, SAMPLING, OR MONITORING.  VCU RRC WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO VMRC AND WILL DEVELOP AN HCP TO SUPPORT THE ITP PERMIT APPLICATION.  THE RRC WILL WORK IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH VMRC TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY DATA TO INFORM THE HCP. VMRC BEGAN THIS PROCESS WHEN ATLANTIC STURGEON WERE FIRST LISTED AS FEDERALLY ENDANGERED, BUT THE AGENCY LACKED THE NECESSARY DATA AND RESOURCES TO COMPLETE THE EFFORT AT THAT TIME. THIS PROJECT WILL BUILD ON THOSE INITIAL EFFORTS TO COLLABORATIVELY DEVELOP MATERIALS TO SUPPORT AN APPLICATION. NOTE THAT VMRC WILL DEVELOP AND SUBMIT THE FINAL ITP APPLICATION SEPARATE FROM THIS EFFORT.
VCUÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã¢Â€ŽÂ¢S RRC IS AT THE CENTER OF EFFORTS TO RESTORE THE ATLANTIC STURGEON TO ITS NATIVE RANGE AND HISTORICAL STATURE WITHIN STATE WATERS. BEGINNING IN 2012, RRC DOCUMENTED FALL SPAWNING ACTIVITY OVERTURNING THE LONG-STANDING ASSUMPTION OF SPRING-ONLY SPAWNING, WHICH HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CHESAPEAKE BAY STURGEON.

The National Coastal Zone Management Program, under the Coastal Zone Management Act, is an important voluntary federal-state partnership that protects, restores, and responsibly develops our nations coastal communities and resources by balancing economic development, coastal uses, and natural resource protection. NOAAs investment of over $3.1M is leveraging $2.6M in state and local funds.  These funds will support jobs and provide continued assistance to the Virginia coastal management program to address many important coastal issues in the state including coastal hazards and resilience, habitat restoration and protection, ocean planning, and stewardship programs and activities. The funding also supports ongoing coastal community planning, marine debris reduction, wetland and shoreline mapping and permitting, beach and dunes protection, water quality management, and public outreach and education.  The award also is supporting the following new initiatives:  An assessment of public financing options in support of coastal dredging and resilience activities in rural jurisdictions.   Expansion of technical assistance and training for resilience planning, including use of the Resilience Adaptation Feasibility Tool in the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission and continued support for the Community Rating System across many localities to reduce insurance premiums.  Characterization and mapping of aggregate resources for purposes of contributions to resilience-related infrastructure projects such as the raising of critical roadways in the face of sea level rise and flooding.  Development of a draft Virginia Ocean Plan to guide decision-making in ways that balance emerging economic ocean uses with conservation of coastal resources and preservation of traditional uses.  The award also supports all Virginia coastal communities through resilience-focused coordination, planning, and technical assistance offered by the eight coastal Planning District Commissions to local government units in the Commonwealth. This effort continues the successful advancement of community best practices consistent with direction from the Virginia coastal resilience master plan. Work will include identifying regional resilience priorities, effective stakeholder and public engagement, technical assistance, geospatial analyses, and updates to a statewide resilience database capturing projects and best practices.",11.419: COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION AWARDS,sub-grant,9776299A-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,12,NA24NOSX419C0026 92.02,55000.00,2024-11-26,2025,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY WILL PROVIDE A NATURAL RESOURCES PROGRAM MANAGER/POLICY ANALYST TO SERVE AS THE VA OCEAN FISHERIES COORDINATOR (FC) FOR THE VA CZM PROGRAM.

Recognizing the limitations of current developmental education approaches to fostering student success in mathematics, the research and practice partnership (RPP) team of researchers and practitioners from the University of California ? Irvine, the Virginia Community College System (VCCS), and the University of Delaware plan to investigate a VCCS initiative designed to reform the support to students who come from high schools that did not prepare them adequately for college. While current reforms focus on one element of developmental education, the RPP effort under study is implementing a more comprehensive approach to support these students as they progress through gateway mathematics. The VCCS initiative includes three components, identifying students who need support, providing concurrent academic support through co-requisite coursework, and providing proactive advising and coaching. Three studies will examine the effects of this effort: (1) a Reform Implementation Study to document how the reform is implemented at each institution and challenges encountered; (2) a Reform Impact Study to examine the impact of the reform on student gateway math outcomes, as well as downstream STEM pathway success and distal outcomes including degree attainment and labor market performance; and (3) a Math Instruction Study to explore whether specific ways of delivering the co-requisite support and teaching approaches are associated with better student outcomes and smaller racial gaps in gateway mathematics. The RPP also plans to examine how colleges responded to challenges presented by the ongoing COVID pandemic when implementing the reform, whether these changes will persist into the foreseeable future, and what teaching practices are effective in promoting math success by course delivery format. The mixed methods research design is well aligned with project goals, research methodologies, and analyses. The RPP team will collect data through surveys, targeted interviews, and administrative data ans plans to apply a comprehensive developmental education framework to analyze and interpret the data. The results will be used to inform the Direct Enrollment Reform at VCCS and should generate knowledge that other institutions may use to inform their efforts to improve student success, particularly when entry into and completion of gateway mathematics courses pose challenges. The NSF program description on Advancing Innovation and Impact in Undergraduate STEM Education at Two-year Institutions of Higher Education supports projects that advance STEM education initiatives at two-year colleges. The program description promotes innovative and evidence-based practices in undergraduate STEM education at two-year colleges. This project is also supported b the NSF IUSE-HSI program, which has the goals of enhancing the quality of undergraduate STEM education, and increasing the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of students pursuing associate?s or baccalaureate degrees in STEM.

DIGITAL GEOSPATIAL DATASETS WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE FOR INCORPORATION INTO LOCAL GIS SYSTEMS THROUGH OUR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE.  THE LOCALITY LIAISON WILL WORK CONSULTATIVELY WITH LOCALITY PLANNERS TO INCORPORATE NATURAL HERITAGE RESOURCE CONCERNS INTO LOCAL COMPREHENSIVE PLANS AND PERMITTING PROCESSES.  THE LOCALITY LIAISON WILL ALSO ASSIST LOCALITIES AND LOCAL CONSERVATION PARTNERS TO IDENTIFY HABITAT CONSERVATION OPPORTUNITIES USING TOOLS SUCH AS CONSERVEVIRGINIA, VIRGINIA CONSERVATIONVISION AND THE VIRGINIA ECOLOGICAL VALUE ASSESSMENT (VEVA). AN OVERALL GOAL OF THE DCR-DNH PROGRAM IS THAT 100% OF THE COUNTIES AND CITIES THROUGHOUT THE VIRGINIA COASTAL ZONE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO NATURAL HERITAGE INFORMATION BY THE END OF THE GRANT CYCLE. THE PERCENTAGE OF LOCALITIES WITH NATURAL HERITAGE INFORMATION IS 100% WITHIN THE COASTAL ZONE OF VIRGINIA. DCR-DNH WILL STRIVE TO MAINTAIN UPDATED LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH LOCALITIES SO THAT LOCALITY ACCESS TO DCR-DNH DATA REMAINS CURRENT. DCR-DNH WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE UPDATED NATURAL HERITAGE INFORMATION TO ALL PDCS AND INTERESTED LAND TRUSTS IN THE COASTAL ZONE REGION THROUGH NHDE AND/OR ARCGIS SHAPEFILES, WITH THE GOAL OF REACHING 100% OF APPROPRIATE AND RELEVANT LAND TRUSTS IN THE COASTAL ZONE. SOLAR NATIVE POLLINATOR HABITAT TOOLS DEVELOPED THROUGH THE VIRGINIA POLLINATOR SMART PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROMOTED TO ENCOURAGE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS IN THE COASTAL ZONE, INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VIRGINIA NATIVE SEED INDUSTRY AND POLLINATOR SMART SIGNAGE FOR CERTIFIED FACILITIES.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_NA24NOSX419C0026_013/,2024-12-03 00:00:00+00

BPD results in a significant burden to families and increased health care utilization. In the United States alone BPD accounts for over $2.4 billion in healthcare costs annually.  Ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) an accepted and important contributor to BPD. Exposure to oxygen and positive pressure ventilation leads to developmental arrest and parenchymal injury in the immature preterm lung. Because even brief exposure to positive pressure ventilation is injurious, avoiding invasive intubated mechanical ventilation is the most widely acknowledged strategy to prevent VILI and the long-term sequela of BPD. Therefore, time on ventilators and rates of successful extubation are important endpoints of therapy.  Lung protective strategies prioritize non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants with respiratory failure, but failure rates of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy are high. In meta-analysis of available trials, both synchronized and non-synchronized non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) are superior to CPAP for preventing extubation failure in preterm infants. A stronger effect size was observed for synchronized NIPPV vs. CPAP than for non-synchronized NIPPV vs. CPAP. However, until recently no FDA-approved reliable methods to provide synchronized NIPPV for preterm infants were available in the US  Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA), an FDA approved technology, is a novel method to synchronize ventilatory support with infant respiratory drive. This effective non-invasive synchronization matches electrical diaphragmatic activity to deliver synchronized and accurate tidal volumes in proportion to the neural signal. To date, the clinical impact of non-invasive NAVA (NIV-NAVA) on clinical outcomes in preterm infants has not been established. In these clustered UG3/UH3 and U24 applications, we propose a pragmatic, unblinded, phase III clinical trial in 478 extremely preterm infants of 24 0/7- 27 6/7 weeks gestational age to determine if NIV-NAVA, compared with non-synchronized NIPPV, prevents extubation failure within 5 days of extubation from mechanical ventilation.",93.837: CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES RESEARCH,sub-grant,35942C76-FCD2-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,4,586554,24000.00,2024-03-02,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,CLINICAL PRACTICES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980276,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"SITES WILL BE RESPONSIBLE TO SCREEN FOR ELIGIBLE PATIENTS TO BE ENROLLED AS PER RESEARCH STRATEGY.

The WIOA Adult program enables workers to obtain good jobs by providing them with career services like job search assistance and training opportunities. Activities to be performed: WIOA specifies that most Adult program services will be provided through the American Job Center network, also known as one-stop career centers. Under the WIOA Adult program, eligible individuals can receive career services, which are classified into two categories: basic and individualized services. While some job seekers may only need self-service or other basic career services such as labor exchange services, others may need more comprehensive services, such as individualized services, which include career planning, and developing an individual employment plan outlining needs and goals of the job seeker. Participants will also receive training services linked to job opportunities in their communities. To promote customer choice and involvement in career decisions, participants use an Individual Training Account to select an appropriate training program from an eligible training provider list. WIOA also authorizes the provision of supportive services (e.g. transportation and child care assistance) to enable an individual to participate in the program.Expected Outcomes: The WIOA Adult program outcomes are to ensure that individuals can access and receive the employment and training services they are eligible for, so that they may become employed or advance in employment. Grantees report performance measures of these outcomes, including the percentage of people employed in the second and fourth quarter after finishing the program, their earnings, and the percentage of people who obtained a credential.Intended beneficiaries: WIOA Adult funds must give priority to recipients of public assistance, other low-income individuals, and individuals who are basic skills deficient. Other categories include unemployed adults, dislocated workers, veterans, individuals with barriers to employment, and any eligible population.Subrecipient Activities: The grantees may subaward funds from the WIOA Adult program to provide some of the individualized career services, training, as well as provide supportive services.",17.258: WIOA ADULT PROGRAM,sub-grant,5580B3CE-FCCD-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2023,12,LWDA 9-23-04,1426775.00,2023-11-02,2024,H1QHB3BCK665,074735515,COUNTY OF HENRICO,,,,,USA,United States,4301 E PARHAM RD,HENRICO,VA,VIRGINIA,232282745,VA-07,VA-04,,"U.S. LOCAL GOVERNMENT,COUNTY",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232232716.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,FY 2024 ADVANCE PY 2023 ADULT,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_23A55AT000020_1601/,2023-12-20 00:00:00+00

By statute, SCSEP state grants are awarded to Governors (22  of total grant funding) and are determined by formula  national non-profits (National grantee) that operate in multi-state service areas (78  of total grant funding) are awarded grants through a competition every four year. Appropriation levels determine the number of total slots, and grantees serve all slots in their service area.

To help self-manage and cope with OAB, many people adopt compensatory bladder behaviors, such as restricting fluids, using containment products, strategic planning and mapping restroom access, and even curtailing activities or travel altogether, which further adversely impact QOL. These behaviors may be driven by anxiety and stress related to urinary urgency and incontinence episodes as well as ensuing distress and embarrassment. Prior research has linked anxiety and OAB: up to 40% of women and 30% of men with OAB also have generalized anxiety disorder. The link between stress and OAB is less studied. In animals, experimental stress can cause OAB-like symptoms and behaviors as well as bladder and somatic hypersensitivity. In limited human studies, women with OAB may have greater physiologic and psychologic stress reactivity, and acute stress may exacerbate urinary urgency. However, how stress impacts on the bladder in the context of OAB or what psychological factors drive compensatory behaviors that impair QOL in OAB remain unknown, as there are no highly-controlled studies of anxiety-OAB links. Understanding these relationships would be a critical advance to individualizing care of patients with OAB. The proposed project will comprehensively investigate for the first time how stress, anxiety and OAB interact, including the impacts on bladder sensitivity, urinary symptoms, and compensatory bladder behaviors. We propose a feedforward loop, whereby increased OAB symptoms increase anxiety (via response to coping with stressful situations), which in turn increases OAB symptoms (via increased bladder sensitivity). We further propose that compensatory behaviors are driven by anxiety-related learning processes that help perpetuate this relationship. We will test our hypotheses in a sample of men and women with OAB and healthy controls. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that acute, experimentally induced psychological stress will be more strongly associated with increased bladder sensitivity in OAB patients than in controls, using a novel bladder sensation meter with oral hydration and stress induction procedures. Aim will test the hypothesis that psychological stress and anxiety will have concurrent and lagged effects on day-to-day urinary symptoms that are stronger in individuals with OAB than in controls, using an ecological momentary assessment approach (7-day electronic diary) to examine prospective associations between everyday perceived stress, anxiety and urinary symptoms.

To help self-manage and cope with OAB, many people adopt compensatory bladder behaviors, such as restricting fluids, using containment products, strategic planning and mapping restroom access, and even curtailing activities or travel altogether, which further adversely impact QOL. These behaviors may be driven by anxiety and stress related to urinary urgency and incontinence episodes as well as ensuing distress and embarrassment. Prior research has linked anxiety and OAB: up to 40% of women and 30% of men with OAB also have generalized anxiety disorder. The link between stress and OAB is less studied. In animals, experimental stress can cause OAB-like symptoms and behaviors as well as bladder and somatic hypersensitivity. In limited human studies, women with OAB may have greater physiologic and psychologic stress reactivity, and acute stress may exacerbate urinary urgency. However, how stress impacts on the bladder in the context of OAB or what psychological factors drive compensatory behaviors that impair QOL in OAB remain unknown, as there are no highly-controlled studies of anxiety-OAB links. Understanding these relationships would be a critical advance to individualizing care of patients with OAB. The proposed project will comprehensively investigate for the first time how stress, anxiety and OAB interact, including the impacts on bladder sensitivity, urinary symptoms, and compensatory bladder behaviors. We propose a feedforward loop, whereby increased OAB symptoms increase anxiety (via response to coping with stressful situations), which in turn increases OAB symptoms (via increased bladder sensitivity). We further propose that compensatory behaviors are driven by anxiety-related learning processes that help perpetuate this relationship. We will test our hypotheses in a sample of men and women with OAB and healthy controls. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that acute, experimentally induced psychological stress will be more strongly associated with increased bladder sensitivity in OAB patients than in controls, using a novel bladder sensation meter with oral hydration and stress induction procedures. Aim will test the hypothesis that psychological stress and anxiety will have concurrent and lagged effects on day-to-day urinary symptoms that are stronger in individuals with OAB than in controls, using an ecological momentary assessment approach (7-day electronic diary) to examine prospective associations between everyday perceived stress, anxiety and urinary symptoms. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that compensatory behaviors (i.e. coping) used at the time of voiding will be associated with subsequent reductions in anxiety levels, using a 3-day sensation-related bladder diary that captures concurrent bladder behaviors and anxiety symptoms as well as lagged symptoms 30 minutes post-void. Delineating these relationships and patterns will allow for identification of potentially modifiable factors or areas for intervention, which we envision as a future R01 clinical trial submission.","93.847: DIABETES, DIGESTIVE, AND KIDNEY DISEASES EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH",sub-grant,C6D57542-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2023,11,96459,24469.00,2023-10-17,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,VUMC,,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849040.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,STRESS AND ANXIETY EFFECTS ON OVERACTIVE BLADDER: A CONTROLLED STUDY,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R01DK129624_075/,2023-11-21 00:00:00+00

The program is authorized under Title 1 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Public Law 93-383, as amended 42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq. The CDBG Program covers four distinct programs, each with their own set of governing regulations: CDBG Entitlement, CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii, CDBG Insular Areas, and State CDBG.

In the CDBG Entitlement Program, HUD awards grants to entitlement community grantees to carry out a wide range of community development activities. Entitlement communities develop their own programs and funding priorities.

In the CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii Program, three counties qualify: Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui. The FY 2004 Appropriations Act required the Governor of Hawaii to decide if the State wished to participate in the State CDBG program by July 31, 2004. The State made the decision not to participate in the program. As a result of this decision HUD's Honolulu Field Office administers the non-entitled grants in Hawaii. Funds are allocated using a formula based on population, poverty, and housing overcrowding, with the poverty factor carrying a double weight.

For the CDBG Insular Areas Program, HUD annually allocates CDBG grants to four designated areas: American Samoa; Guam; Northern Mariana Islands; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The funds are allocated in proportion to the populations of the eligible Territories. The program is administered by HUD's Field Offices in Puerto Rico and Hawaii.  

Under the State CDBG Program, States pass through CDBG grants to units of general local government. Annually, each State develops funding priorities and criteria for selecting projects. Since States are in the best position to know, and to respond to, the needs of local governments, Congress amended the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act) in 1981 to give each State the opportunity to administer CDBG funds for non-entitlement areas. Non-entitlement areas include those units of general local government which do not receive CDBG funds directly from HUD. Generally, non-entitlement areas are cities with populations of less than 50,000 (except cities that are designated principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas), and counties with populations of less than 200,000.

Current CDBG awards and allocations are included in this list of HUD Community Planning and Development (CPD) awards and allocations located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/GRANTEES/ALLOCATIONS-AWARDS/; Activities to be Performed: CDBG funds may be used for activities which include, but are not limited to: Acquisition of real property; Relocation and demolition; Rehabilitation of residential and non-residential structures; Construction of public facilities and improvements, such as water and sewer facilities, streets, neighborhood centers, and the conversion of school buildings for eligible purposes; Public services, within certain limits; Activities relating to energy conservation and renewable energy resources; Provision of assistance to profit-motivated businesses to carry out economic development and job creation/retention activities. Each activity must meet one of the following national objectives for the program: benefit low- and moderate-income persons, prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or address community development needs having a particular urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community for which other funding is not available. Generally, the following types of activities are ineligible: Acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of buildings for the general conduct of government; Political activities; Certain income payments; Construction of new housing (with some exceptions). 

Under the State CDBG Program, States may use $100,000 plus up to a maximum of three percent of its CDBG allocation. Amounts expended on administration in excess of $100,000 must be matched. States may expend up to three percent of their CDBG allocation on technical assistance activities. However, the total a state spends on both administrative and technical assistance expenses may not exceed $100,000 plus three percent of the state's allocation.

CPD has developed profiles that display grantee-reported accomplishments for selected housing, economic development, public improvement, and public service activities. Profiles for grantees will vary, as grantees have flexibility in determining the housing, economic, and community development activities they carry out with CDBG funds. The most recent accomplishments can be viewed within the National Accomplishment Reports located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg/cdbg-accomplishment-reports/; Expected Outcomes: The CDBG program reinforces several important values and principles of community development: program flexibility to empower people and communities to design and implement strategies tailored to their own needs and priorities; an emphasis on consolidated planning that expands and strengthens partnerships among all levels of government and the private sector in enhancing community development; technical assistance activities and set-aside for grantees to build the capacity of these partners. Each CDBG grantee’s expected outcomes are described as goals in their Consolidated Plan.  The most recent Consolidated Plans can be viewed at: https://www.hudexchange.info/grantees/reports/#consolidated-plans-annual-action-plans-and-capers; Intended Beneficiaries: Over a 1, 2, or 3-year period, as selected by the grantee, not less than 70 percent of CDBG funds must be used for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons. HUD does not provide CDBG assistance directly to individuals, businesses, nonprofit or organizations or other non-governmental entities. Individuals who are interested in participating in this program, should contact their local municipal or county officials to find out how the program operates in their community. Participation requirements may differ from one grantee to another. 

With the exception of the State CDBG Program, the local government grantee administers the CDBG program and determines which local projects receive funding. Eligible grantees are as follows: Principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs); Other metropolitan cities with populations of at least 50,000; Qualified urban counties with populations of at least 200,000 (excluding the population of entitled cities); States and insular areas.

The District of Columbia is funded under the CDBG Entitlement Program. The State of Hawaii does not participate, and HUD allocates the state's share of funds to the three Hawaii non-entitled counties. 

The States administer CDBG funds in the State CDBG Program. Since States are in the best position to know, and to respond to, the needs of local governments, Congress amended the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act) in 1981 to give each State the opportunity to administer CDBG funds for non-entitlement areas.; Subrecipient Activities: The subrecipient activities are unknown at the time of award.",14.218: COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS/ENTITLEMENT GRANTS,sub-grant,5FB7F86C-FCBD-11EF-9825-93915A4CF5B0,2025,1,FY25CDBG-05,573500.00,2024-07-22,2024,DAJNAM7EG5D1,804750446,SOUTHSIDE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT & HOUSIN,RICHMOND FLYING SQUIRRELS,DAJNAM7EG5D1,804750446,,USA,United States,1624 HULL ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232243806,VA-04,VA-04,,"MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESS,NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION,BLACK AMERICAN OWNED",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232243806.0,VA-04,VA-04,USA,United States,"SOUTHSIDE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING CORPORATION (SCDHC)S HOMEOWNERSHIP CENTER WILL PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE AND MULTILINGUAL FINANCIAL COACHING THROUGH OUR FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITY CENTER (FOC), AND HUD-CERTIFIED RENTAL, PRE-PURCHASE, POST-PURCHASE, AND FORECLOSURE PREVENTION COUNSELING THROUGH OUR HUD-APPROVED HOUSING COUNSELING CENTER.

The program is authorized under Title 1 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Public Law 93-383, as amended 42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq. The CDBG Program covers four distinct programs, each with their own set of governing regulations: CDBG Entitlement, CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii, CDBG Insular Areas, and State CDBG.

In the CDBG Entitlement Program, HUD awards grants to entitlement community grantees to carry out a wide range of community development activities. Entitlement communities develop their own programs and funding priorities.

In the CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii Program, three counties qualify: Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui. The FY 2004 Appropriations Act required the Governor of Hawaii to decide if the State wished to participate in the State CDBG program by July 31, 2004. The State made the decision not to participate in the program. As a result of this decision HUD's Honolulu Field Office administers the non-entitled grants in Hawaii. Funds are allocated using a formula based on population, poverty, and housing overcrowding, with the poverty factor carrying a double weight.

For the CDBG Insular Areas Program, HUD annually allocates CDBG grants to four designated areas: American Samoa; Guam; Northern Mariana Islands; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The funds are allocated in proportion to the populations of the eligible Territories. The program is administered by HUD's Field Offices in Puerto Rico and Hawaii.  

Under the State CDBG Program, States pass through CDBG grants to units of general local government. Annually, each State develops funding priorities and criteria for selecting projects. Since States are in the best position to know, and to respond to, the needs of local governments, Congress amended the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act) in 1981 to give each State the opportunity to administer CDBG funds for non-entitlement areas. Non-entitlement areas include those units of general local government which do not receive CDBG funds directly from HUD. Generally, non-entitlement areas are cities with populations of less than 50,000 (except cities that are designated principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas), and counties with populations of less than 200,000.

Current CDBG awards and allocations are included in this list of HUD Community Planning and Development (CPD) awards and allocations located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/GRANTEES/ALLOCATIONS-AWARDS/; Activities to be Performed: CDBG funds may be used for activities which include, but are not limited to: Acquisition of real property; Relocation and demolition; Rehabilitation of residential and non-residential structures; Construction of public facilities and improvements, such as water and sewer facilities, streets, neighborhood centers, and the conversion of school buildings for eligible purposes; Public services, within certain limits; Activities relating to energy conservation and renewable energy resources; Provision of assistance to profit-motivated businesses to carry out economic development and job creation/retention activities. Each activity must meet one of the following national objectives for the program: benefit low- and moderate-income persons, prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or address community development needs having a particular urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community for which other funding is not available. Generally, the following types of activities are ineligible: Acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of buildings for the general conduct of government; Political activities; Certain income payments; Construction of new housing (with some exceptions). 

Under the State CDBG Program, States may use $100,000 plus up to a maximum of three percent of its CDBG allocation. Amounts expended on administration in excess of $100,000 must be matched. States may expend up to three percent of their CDBG allocation on technical assistance activities. However, the total a state spends on both administrative and technical assistance expenses may not exceed $100,000 plus three percent of the state's allocation.

CPD has developed profiles that display grantee-reported accomplishments for selected housing, economic development, public improvement, and public service activities. Profiles for grantees will vary, as grantees have flexibility in determining the housing, economic, and community development activities they carry out with CDBG funds. The most recent accomplishments can be viewed within the National Accomplishment Reports located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg/cdbg-accomplishment-reports/; Expected Outcomes: The CDBG program reinforces several important values and principles of community development: program flexibility to empower people and communities to design and implement strategies tailored to their own needs and priorities; an emphasis on consolidated planning that expands and strengthens partnerships among all levels of government and the private sector in enhancing community development; technical assistance activities and set-aside for grantees to build the capacity of these partners. Each CDBG grantee’s expected outcomes are described as goals in their Consolidated Plan.  The most recent Consolidated Plans can be viewed at: https://www.hudexchange.info/grantees/reports/#consolidated-plans-annual-action-plans-and-capers; Intended Beneficiaries: Over a 1, 2, or 3-year period, as selected by the grantee, not less than 70 percent of CDBG funds must be used for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons. HUD does not provide CDBG assistance directly to individuals, businesses, nonprofit or organizations or other non-governmental entities. Individuals who are interested in participating in this program, should contact their local municipal or county officials to find out how the program operates in their community. Participation requirements may differ from one grantee to another. 

With the exception of the State CDBG Program, the local government grantee administers the CDBG program and determines which local projects receive funding. Eligible grantees are as follows: Principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs); Other metropolitan cities with populations of at least 50,000; Qualified urban counties with populations of at least 200,000 (excluding the population of entitled cities); States and insular areas.

IT HAS BEEN HYPOTHESIZED THAT ABNORMAL BRAIN DEVELOPMENT CAN CAUSE LONG-TERM ALTERATIONS IN BRAIN CIRCUITRY THAT MAY LATER MANIFEST IN BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS IN THE ADULT. CONSISTENT WITH THIS IDEA, A SIGNIFICANT SUBSET (~25-30%) OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD) IS ASSOCIATED WITH A TRANSIENT BUT SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BRAIN SIZE IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF LIFE, LEADING TO ABNORMAL SOCIAL AND OTHER BEHAVIORS. IN FURTHER SUPPORT OF THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE FOUND THAT DISHEVELLED DVL1-/-; DVL3+/- MUTANT MICE DISPLAYED INCREASED NEURAL PROGENITOR CELL (NPC) PROLIFERATION DURING EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT VIA DYSREGULATION OF A NOVEL ÃƑÆ’Ã…Â¸-CATENIN/BRN2 TRANSCRIPTIONAL CASCADE ASSOCIATED WITH ADULT SOCIAL/REPETITIVE BEHAVIOR AND BRAIN ABNORMALITIES (BELINSON ET AL. 2016).

DYSREGULATION OF THIS CASCADE RESULTS IN ABNORMAL SOCIAL BEHAVIOR FROM ABERRANT NEUROGENESIS DURING EMBRYOGENESIS, WHICH SELECTIVELY DISRUPTS ADULT BRAIN STRUCTURE/FUNCTION.

The progression of cirrhosis to liver-associated clinical events (LACE) and death is related to a diverse set of systemic and hepatic factors which may be etiology- specific or agnostic. There remain gaps in knowledge in assessing how these factors interact to cause cirrhosis- progression to outcomes. This limits rational development of non-invasive tools for risk-stratification and disease-monitoring purposes as well as the ability to holistically model the development of outcomes. There is also no established etiology-agnostic approach to reduce the risk of outcomes and death. This proposal, in response to RFA-DK-20-003, addresses these unmet needs with two specific aims: Aim 1: To conduct a prospective, multicenter, observational study of patients with cirrhosis of varying etiology that serves as the foundation for conducting novel mechanistic and therapeutic studies. Patients with compensated cirrhosis of varying etiology inclusive of NASH, ALD with and without HIV will be enrolled and followed prospectively with protocol-driven data and bio-sample collection. Outcomes will be assessed prospectively by a pre-specified adjudication process. Through collaboration with external partners, we will evaluate several promising tools (e.g. spleen-stiffness measurement), circulating biomarkers (PROC3-6, ELF test) and machine-learned approaches to obtain novel insights on fibrosis, factors driving outcomes and to model outcomes. The cohort data and bio-samples will further support mechanistic studies of factors driving fibrosis and outcomes. Aim 2: To perform a multi-center prospective randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the clinical utility of atorvastatin (10 mg/day x 2 yrs) in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Patients with compensated cirrhosis of varying etiology, stratified by varices and CTP score (5 or 6) will be enrolled. The trial design uses the estimand framework proposed by the FDA (ICH E9 R1). The primary endpoint captures benefit from a patient-perspective and is defined by survival without LACE or major adverse cardiac event or need for drug withdrawal for toxicity.

The progression of cirrhosis to liver-associated clinical events (LACE) and death is related to a diverse set of systemic and hepatic factors which may be etiology- specific or agnostic. There remain gaps in knowledge in assessing how these factors interact to cause cirrhosis- progression to outcomes. This limits rational development of non-invasive tools for risk-stratification and disease-monitoring purposes as well as the ability to holistically model the development of outcomes. There is also no established etiology-agnostic approach to reduce the risk of outcomes and death. This proposal, in response to RFA-DK-20-003, addresses these unmet needs with two specific aims: Aim 1: To conduct a prospective, multicenter, observational study of patients with cirrhosis of varying etiology that serves as the foundation for conducting novel mechanistic and therapeutic studies. Patients with compensated cirrhosis of varying etiology inclusive of NASH, ALD with and without HIV will be enrolled and followed prospectively with protocol-driven data and bio-sample collection. Outcomes will be assessed prospectively by a pre-specified adjudication process. Through collaboration with external partners, we will evaluate several promising tools (e.g. spleen-stiffness measurement), circulating biomarkers (PROC3-6, ELF test) and machine-learned approaches to obtain novel insights on fibrosis, factors driving outcomes and to model outcomes. The cohort data and bio-samples will further support mechanistic studies of factors driving fibrosis and outcomes. Aim 2: To perform a multi-center prospective randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the clinical utility of atorvastatin (10 mg/day x 2 yrs) in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Patients with compensated cirrhosis of varying etiology, stratified by varices and CTP score (5 or 6) will be enrolled. The trial design uses the estimand framework proposed by the FDA (ICH E9 R1). The primary endpoint captures benefit from a patient-perspective and is defined by survival without LACE or major adverse cardiac event or need for drug withdrawal for toxicity. The primary analysis will be a comparison of proportions of patients meeting the primary endpoint. The secondary analysis of benefit is a time-to-event analysis of clinical outcomes. Several measures to track safety and de-risk the study are proposed. A benefit-risk analyses using state of the art approach is proposed. Together, they will provide robust information on the utility of atorvastatin to improve outcomes in compensated cirrhosis. The feasibility of the studies is supported by a strong and extensive referral network, a robust tele-medicine program for liver disease and research infrastructure.

The program is authorized under Title 1 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Public Law 93-383, as amended 42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq. The CDBG Program covers four distinct programs, each with their own set of governing regulations: CDBG Entitlement, CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii, CDBG Insular Areas, and State CDBG.

In the CDBG Entitlement Program, HUD awards grants to entitlement community grantees to carry out a wide range of community development activities. Entitlement communities develop their own programs and funding priorities.

In the CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii Program, three counties qualify: Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui. The FY 2004 Appropriations Act required the Governor of Hawaii to decide if the State wished to participate in the State CDBG program by July 31, 2004. The State made the decision not to participate in the program. As a result of this decision HUD's Honolulu Field Office administers the non-entitled grants in Hawaii. Funds are allocated using a formula based on population, poverty, and housing overcrowding, with the poverty factor carrying a double weight.

For the CDBG Insular Areas Program, HUD annually allocates CDBG grants to four designated areas: American Samoa; Guam; Northern Mariana Islands; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The funds are allocated in proportion to the populations of the eligible Territories. The program is administered by HUD's Field Offices in Puerto Rico and Hawaii.  

Under the State CDBG Program, States pass through CDBG grants to units of general local government. Annually, each State develops funding priorities and criteria for selecting projects. Since States are in the best position to know, and to respond to, the needs of local governments, Congress amended the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act) in 1981 to give each State the opportunity to administer CDBG funds for non-entitlement areas. Non-entitlement areas include those units of general local government which do not receive CDBG funds directly from HUD. Generally, non-entitlement areas are cities with populations of less than 50,000 (except cities that are designated principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas), and counties with populations of less than 200,000.

Current CDBG awards and allocations are included in this list of HUD Community Planning and Development (CPD) awards and allocations located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/GRANTEES/ALLOCATIONS-AWARDS/; Activities to be Performed: CDBG funds may be used for activities which include, but are not limited to: Acquisition of real property; Relocation and demolition; Rehabilitation of residential and non-residential structures; Construction of public facilities and improvements, such as water and sewer facilities, streets, neighborhood centers, and the conversion of school buildings for eligible purposes; Public services, within certain limits; Activities relating to energy conservation and renewable energy resources; Provision of assistance to profit-motivated businesses to carry out economic development and job creation/retention activities. Each activity must meet one of the following national objectives for the program: benefit low- and moderate-income persons, prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or address community development needs having a particular urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community for which other funding is not available. Generally, the following types of activities are ineligible: Acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of buildings for the general conduct of government; Political activities; Certain income payments; Construction of new housing (with some exceptions). 

Under the State CDBG Program, States may use $100,000 plus up to a maximum of three percent of its CDBG allocation. Amounts expended on administration in excess of $100,000 must be matched. States may expend up to three percent of their CDBG allocation on technical assistance activities. However, the total a state spends on both administrative and technical assistance expenses may not exceed $100,000 plus three percent of the state's allocation.

CPD has developed profiles that display grantee-reported accomplishments for selected housing, economic development, public improvement, and public service activities. Profiles for grantees will vary, as grantees have flexibility in determining the housing, economic, and community development activities they carry out with CDBG funds. The most recent accomplishments can be viewed within the National Accomplishment Reports located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg/cdbg-accomplishment-reports/; Expected Outcomes: The CDBG program reinforces several important values and principles of community development: program flexibility to empower people and communities to design and implement strategies tailored to their own needs and priorities; an emphasis on consolidated planning that expands and strengthens partnerships among all levels of government and the private sector in enhancing community development; technical assistance activities and set-aside for grantees to build the capacity of these partners. Each CDBG grantee’s expected outcomes are described as goals in their Consolidated Plan.  The most recent Consolidated Plans can be viewed at: https://www.hudexchange.info/grantees/reports/#consolidated-plans-annual-action-plans-and-capers; Intended Beneficiaries: Over a 1, 2, or 3-year period, as selected by the grantee, not less than 70 percent of CDBG funds must be used for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons. HUD does not provide CDBG assistance directly to individuals, businesses, nonprofit or organizations or other non-governmental entities. Individuals who are interested in participating in this program, should contact their local municipal or county officials to find out how the program operates in their community. Participation requirements may differ from one grantee to another. 

With the exception of the State CDBG Program, the local government grantee administers the CDBG program and determines which local projects receive funding. Eligible grantees are as follows: Principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs); Other metropolitan cities with populations of at least 50,000; Qualified urban counties with populations of at least 200,000 (excluding the population of entitled cities); States and insular areas.

The District of Columbia is funded under the CDBG Entitlement Program. The State of Hawaii does not participate, and HUD allocates the state's share of funds to the three Hawaii non-entitled counties. 

The States administer CDBG funds in the State CDBG Program. Since States are in the best position to know, and to respond to, the needs of local governments, Congress amended the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act) in 1981 to give each State the opportunity to administer CDBG funds for non-entitlement areas.; Subrecipient Activities: The subrecipient activities are unknown at the time of award.",14.218: COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS/ENTITLEMENT GRANTS,sub-grant,5FB7E21E-FCBD-11EF-9825-93915A4CF5B0,2025,1,FY25CDBG-06,225000.00,2024-07-22,2024,KL3LKWK45VK5,787207281,CARITAS,RICHMOND FLYING SQUIRRELS,KL3LKWK45VK5,787207281,,USA,United States,2220 STOCKTON ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232243707,VA-03,VA-04,,"DOMESTIC SHELTER,NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232243707.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"FUNDS WILL BE USED FOR ONGOING RENOVATION OF THE DINWIDDIE AVENUE MENÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S CAMPUS, WHICH IS A LOW BARRIER SHELTER FOR SINGLE ADULT MALES.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_B-24-MC-51-0019_086/,2025-01-10 00:00:00+00

The progression of cirrhosis to liver-associated clinical events (LACE) and death is related to a diverse set of systemic and hepatic factors which may be etiology- specific or agnostic. There remain gaps in knowledge in assessing how these factors interact to cause cirrhosis- progression to outcomes. This limits rational development of non-invasive tools for risk-stratification and disease-monitoring purposes as well as the ability to holistically model the development of outcomes. There is also no established etiology-agnostic approach to reduce the risk of outcomes and death. This proposal, in response to RFA-DK-20-003, addresses these unmet needs with two specific aims: Aim 1: To conduct a prospective, multicenter, observational study of patients with cirrhosis of varying etiology that serves as the foundation for conducting novel mechanistic and therapeutic studies. Patients with compensated cirrhosis of varying etiology inclusive of NASH, ALD with and without HIV will be enrolled and followed prospectively with protocol-driven data and bio-sample collection. Outcomes will be assessed prospectively by a pre-specified adjudication process. Through collaboration with external partners, we will evaluate several promising tools (e.g. spleen-stiffness measurement), circulating biomarkers (PROC3-6, ELF test) and machine-learned approaches to obtain novel insights on fibrosis, factors driving outcomes and to model outcomes. The cohort data and bio-samples will further support mechanistic studies of factors driving fibrosis and outcomes. Aim 2: To perform a multi-center prospective randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the clinical utility of atorvastatin (10 mg/day x 2 yrs) in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Patients with compensated cirrhosis of varying etiology, stratified by varices and CTP score (5 or 6) will be enrolled. The trial design uses the estimand framework proposed by the FDA (ICH E9 R1). The primary endpoint captures benefit from a patient-perspective and is defined by survival without LACE or major adverse cardiac event or need for drug withdrawal for toxicity. The primary analysis will be a comparison of proportions of patients meeting the primary endpoint. The secondary analysis of benefit is a time-to-event analysis of clinical outcomes. Several measures to track safety and de-risk the study are proposed. A benefit-risk analyses using state of the art approach is proposed. Together, they will provide robust information on the utility of atorvastatin to improve outcomes in compensated cirrhosis. The feasibility of the studies is supported by a strong and extensive referral network, a robust tele-medicine program for liver disease and research infrastructure. The studies will have a major positive impact by: (1) providing robust outcomes data, (2) supporting mechanistic studies, (3) use of innovations to refine application of NITs, (4) model clinical outcome risk to inform future monitoring strategies, and (5) provide a treatment to slow this progression, thereby providing a way to reduce the burden of cirrhosis.","93.273: ALCOHOL RESEARCH PROGRAMS; 93.847: DIABETES, DIGESTIVE, AND KIDNEY DISEASES EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH",sub-grant,21D889A2-FCD2-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2023,11,FP00014295_SA001,57843.00,2023-11-08,2024,CLC6REB58U73,785883331,RICHMOND INSTITUTE FOR VETERANS RESEARCH,,,,,USA,United States,1201 BROAD ROCK BLVD,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232490001,VA-03,VA-04,,NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232490001,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,LIVER CIRRHOSIS NETWORK: CLINICAL RESEARCH CENTERS,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_U01DK130134_075/,2023-11-30 00:00:00+00

The program is authorized under Title 1 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Public Law 93-383, as amended 42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq. The CDBG Program covers four distinct programs, each with their own set of governing regulations: CDBG Entitlement, CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii, CDBG Insular Areas, and State CDBG.

In the CDBG Entitlement Program, HUD awards grants to entitlement community grantees to carry out a wide range of community development activities. Entitlement communities develop their own programs and funding priorities.

In the CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii Program, three counties qualify: Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui. The FY 2004 Appropriations Act required the Governor of Hawaii to decide if the State wished to participate in the State CDBG program by July 31, 2004. The State made the decision not to participate in the program. As a result of this decision HUD's Honolulu Field Office administers the non-entitled grants in Hawaii. Funds are allocated using a formula based on population, poverty, and housing overcrowding, with the poverty factor carrying a double weight.

For the CDBG Insular Areas Program, HUD annually allocates CDBG grants to four designated areas: American Samoa; Guam; Northern Mariana Islands; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The funds are allocated in proportion to the populations of the eligible Territories. The program is administered by HUD's Field Offices in Puerto Rico and Hawaii.  

Under the State CDBG Program, States pass through CDBG grants to units of general local government. Annually, each State develops funding priorities and criteria for selecting projects. Since States are in the best position to know, and to respond to, the needs of local governments, Congress amended the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act) in 1981 to give each State the opportunity to administer CDBG funds for non-entitlement areas. Non-entitlement areas include those units of general local government which do not receive CDBG funds directly from HUD. Generally, non-entitlement areas are cities with populations of less than 50,000 (except cities that are designated principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas), and counties with populations of less than 200,000.

Current CDBG awards and allocations are included in this list of HUD Community Planning and Development (CPD) awards and allocations located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/GRANTEES/ALLOCATIONS-AWARDS/; Activities to be Performed: CDBG funds may be used for activities which include, but are not limited to: Acquisition of real property; Relocation and demolition; Rehabilitation of residential and non-residential structures; Construction of public facilities and improvements, such as water and sewer facilities, streets, neighborhood centers, and the conversion of school buildings for eligible purposes; Public services, within certain limits; Activities relating to energy conservation and renewable energy resources; Provision of assistance to profit-motivated businesses to carry out economic development and job creation/retention activities. Each activity must meet one of the following national objectives for the program: benefit low- and moderate-income persons, prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or address community development needs having a particular urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community for which other funding is not available. Generally, the following types of activities are ineligible: Acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of buildings for the general conduct of government; Political activities; Certain income payments; Construction of new housing (with some exceptions). 

Under the State CDBG Program, States may use $100,000 plus up to a maximum of three percent of its CDBG allocation. Amounts expended on administration in excess of $100,000 must be matched. States may expend up to three percent of their CDBG allocation on technical assistance activities. However, the total a state spends on both administrative and technical assistance expenses may not exceed $100,000 plus three percent of the state's allocation.

CPD has developed profiles that display grantee-reported accomplishments for selected housing, economic development, public improvement, and public service activities. Profiles for grantees will vary, as grantees have flexibility in determining the housing, economic, and community development activities they carry out with CDBG funds. The most recent accomplishments can be viewed within the National Accomplishment Reports located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg/cdbg-accomplishment-reports/; Expected Outcomes: The CDBG program reinforces several important values and principles of community development: program flexibility to empower people and communities to design and implement strategies tailored to their own needs and priorities; an emphasis on consolidated planning that expands and strengthens partnerships among all levels of government and the private sector in enhancing community development; technical assistance activities and set-aside for grantees to build the capacity of these partners. Each CDBG grantee’s expected outcomes are described as goals in their Consolidated Plan.  The most recent Consolidated Plans can be viewed at: https://www.hudexchange.info/grantees/reports/#consolidated-plans-annual-action-plans-and-capers; Intended Beneficiaries: Over a 1, 2, or 3-year period, as selected by the grantee, not less than 70 percent of CDBG funds must be used for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons. HUD does not provide CDBG assistance directly to individuals, businesses, nonprofit or organizations or other non-governmental entities. Individuals who are interested in participating in this program, should contact their local municipal or county officials to find out how the program operates in their community. Participation requirements may differ from one grantee to another. 

With the exception of the State CDBG Program, the local government grantee administers the CDBG program and determines which local projects receive funding. Eligible grantees are as follows: Principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs); Other metropolitan cities with populations of at least 50,000; Qualified urban counties with populations of at least 200,000 (excluding the population of entitled cities); States and insular areas.

The District of Columbia is funded under the CDBG Entitlement Program. The State of Hawaii does not participate, and HUD allocates the state's share of funds to the three Hawaii non-entitled counties. 

The States administer CDBG funds in the State CDBG Program. Since States are in the best position to know, and to respond to, the needs of local governments, Congress amended the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act) in 1981 to give each State the opportunity to administer CDBG funds for non-entitlement areas.; Subrecipient Activities: The subrecipient activities are unknown at the time of award.",14.218: COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS/ENTITLEMENT GRANTS,sub-grant,5FB80140-FCBD-11EF-9825-93915A4CF5B0,2025,1,FY25CDBG-11,200000.00,2024-07-22,2024,TUTBVC7JZJM4,624479747,"HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES MADE EQUAL OF VIRGINIA, INC.",RICHMOND FLYING SQUIRRELS,F8KPF6NKW8D8,,,USA,United States,"626 E BROAD ST

The most recent accomplishments can be viewed within the National Accomplishment Reports located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg/cdbg-accomplishment-reports/; Expected Outcomes: The CDBG program reinforces several important values and principles of community development: program flexibility to empower people and communities to design and implement strategies tailored to their own needs and priorities; an emphasis on consolidated planning that expands and strengthens partnerships among all levels of government and the private sector in enhancing community development; technical assistance activities and set-aside for grantees to build the capacity of these partners. Each CDBG grantee’s expected outcomes are described as goals in their Consolidated Plan.  The most recent Consolidated Plans can be viewed at: https://www.hudexchange.info/grantees/reports/#consolidated-plans-annual-action-plans-and-capers; Intended Beneficiaries: Over a 1, 2, or 3-year period, as selected by the grantee, not less than 70 percent of CDBG funds must be used for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons. HUD does not provide CDBG assistance directly to individuals, businesses, nonprofit or organizations or other non-governmental entities. Individuals who are interested in participating in this program, should contact their local municipal or county officials to find out how the program operates in their community. Participation requirements may differ from one grantee to another. 

With the exception of the State CDBG Program, the local government grantee administers the CDBG program and determines which local projects receive funding. Eligible grantees are as follows: Principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs); Other metropolitan cities with populations of at least 50,000; Qualified urban counties with populations of at least 200,000 (excluding the population of entitled cities); States and insular areas.

The District of Columbia is funded under the CDBG Entitlement Program. The State of Hawaii does not participate, and HUD allocates the state's share of funds to the three Hawaii non-entitled counties. 

The States administer CDBG funds in the State CDBG Program. Since States are in the best position to know, and to respond to, the needs of local governments, Congress amended the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act) in 1981 to give each State the opportunity to administer CDBG funds for non-entitlement areas.; Subrecipient Activities: The subrecipient activities are unknown at the time of award.",14.218: COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS/ENTITLEMENT GRANTS,sub-grant,5FB7E7E6-FCBD-11EF-9825-93915A4CF5B0,2025,1,FY25CDBG-04,533000.00,2024-07-22,2024,TUTBVC7JZJM4,624479747,"HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES MADE EQUAL OF VIRGINIA, INC.",RICHMOND FLYING SQUIRRELS,F8KPF6NKW8D8,,,USA,United States,"626 E BROAD ST

The program is authorized under Title 1 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Public Law 93-383, as amended 42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq. The CDBG Program covers four distinct programs, each with their own set of governing regulations: CDBG Entitlement, CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii, CDBG Insular Areas, and State CDBG.

In the CDBG Entitlement Program, HUD awards grants to entitlement community grantees to carry out a wide range of community development activities. Entitlement communities develop their own programs and funding priorities.

In the CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii Program, three counties qualify: Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui. The FY 2004 Appropriations Act required the Governor of Hawaii to decide if the State wished to participate in the State CDBG program by July 31, 2004. The State made the decision not to participate in the program. As a result of this decision HUD's Honolulu Field Office administers the non-entitled grants in Hawaii. Funds are allocated using a formula based on population, poverty, and housing overcrowding, with the poverty factor carrying a double weight.

For the CDBG Insular Areas Program, HUD annually allocates CDBG grants to four designated areas: American Samoa; Guam; Northern Mariana Islands; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The funds are allocated in proportion to the populations of the eligible Territories. The program is administered by HUD's Field Offices in Puerto Rico and Hawaii.  

Under the State CDBG Program, States pass through CDBG grants to units of general local government. Annually, each State develops funding priorities and criteria for selecting projects. Since States are in the best position to know, and to respond to, the needs of local governments, Congress amended the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act) in 1981 to give each State the opportunity to administer CDBG funds for non-entitlement areas. Non-entitlement areas include those units of general local government which do not receive CDBG funds directly from HUD. Generally, non-entitlement areas are cities with populations of less than 50,000 (except cities that are designated principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas), and counties with populations of less than 200,000.

Current CDBG awards and allocations are included in this list of HUD Community Planning and Development (CPD) awards and allocations located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/GRANTEES/ALLOCATIONS-AWARDS/; Activities to be Performed: CDBG funds may be used for activities which include, but are not limited to: Acquisition of real property; Relocation and demolition; Rehabilitation of residential and non-residential structures; Construction of public facilities and improvements, such as water and sewer facilities, streets, neighborhood centers, and the conversion of school buildings for eligible purposes; Public services, within certain limits; Activities relating to energy conservation and renewable energy resources; Provision of assistance to profit-motivated businesses to carry out economic development and job creation/retention activities. Each activity must meet one of the following national objectives for the program: benefit low- and moderate-income persons, prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or address community development needs having a particular urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community for which other funding is not available. Generally, the following types of activities are ineligible: Acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of buildings for the general conduct of government; Political activities; Certain income payments; Construction of new housing (with some exceptions). 

Under the State CDBG Program, States may use $100,000 plus up to a maximum of three percent of its CDBG allocation. Amounts expended on administration in excess of $100,000 must be matched. States may expend up to three percent of their CDBG allocation on technical assistance activities. However, the total a state spends on both administrative and technical assistance expenses may not exceed $100,000 plus three percent of the state's allocation.

CPD has developed profiles that display grantee-reported accomplishments for selected housing, economic development, public improvement, and public service activities. Profiles for grantees will vary, as grantees have flexibility in determining the housing, economic, and community development activities they carry out with CDBG funds. The most recent accomplishments can be viewed within the National Accomplishment Reports located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg/cdbg-accomplishment-reports/; Expected Outcomes: The CDBG program reinforces several important values and principles of community development: program flexibility to empower people and communities to design and implement strategies tailored to their own needs and priorities; an emphasis on consolidated planning that expands and strengthens partnerships among all levels of government and the private sector in enhancing community development; technical assistance activities and set-aside for grantees to build the capacity of these partners. Each CDBG grantee’s expected outcomes are described as goals in their Consolidated Plan.  The most recent Consolidated Plans can be viewed at: https://www.hudexchange.info/grantees/reports/#consolidated-plans-annual-action-plans-and-capers; Intended Beneficiaries: Over a 1, 2, or 3-year period, as selected by the grantee, not less than 70 percent of CDBG funds must be used for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons.

The program is authorized under Title 1 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Public Law 93-383, as amended 42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq. The CDBG Program covers four distinct programs, each with their own set of governing regulations: CDBG Entitlement, CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii, CDBG Insular Areas, and State CDBG.

In the CDBG Entitlement Program, HUD awards grants to entitlement community grantees to carry out a wide range of community development activities. Entitlement communities develop their own programs and funding priorities.

In the CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii Program, three counties qualify: Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui. The FY 2004 Appropriations Act required the Governor of Hawaii to decide if the State wished to participate in the State CDBG program by July 31, 2004. The State made the decision not to participate in the program. As a result of this decision HUD's Honolulu Field Office administers the non-entitled grants in Hawaii. Funds are allocated using a formula based on population, poverty, and housing overcrowding, with the poverty factor carrying a double weight.

For the CDBG Insular Areas Program, HUD annually allocates CDBG grants to four designated areas: American Samoa; Guam; Northern Mariana Islands; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The funds are allocated in proportion to the populations of the eligible Territories. The program is administered by HUD's Field Offices in Puerto Rico and Hawaii.  

Under the State CDBG Program, States pass through CDBG grants to units of general local government. Annually, each State develops funding priorities and criteria for selecting projects. Since States are in the best position to know, and to respond to, the needs of local governments, Congress amended the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act) in 1981 to give each State the opportunity to administer CDBG funds for non-entitlement areas. Non-entitlement areas include those units of general local government which do not receive CDBG funds directly from HUD. Generally, non-entitlement areas are cities with populations of less than 50,000 (except cities that are designated principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas), and counties with populations of less than 200,000.

Current CDBG awards and allocations are included in this list of HUD Community Planning and Development (CPD) awards and allocations located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/GRANTEES/ALLOCATIONS-AWARDS/; Activities to be Performed: CDBG funds may be used for activities which include, but are not limited to: Acquisition of real property; Relocation and demolition; Rehabilitation of residential and non-residential structures; Construction of public facilities and improvements, such as water and sewer facilities, streets, neighborhood centers, and the conversion of school buildings for eligible purposes; Public services, within certain limits; Activities relating to energy conservation and renewable energy resources; Provision of assistance to profit-motivated businesses to carry out economic development and job creation/retention activities. Each activity must meet one of the following national objectives for the program: benefit low- and moderate-income persons, prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or address community development needs having a particular urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community for which other funding is not available. Generally, the following types of activities are ineligible: Acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of buildings for the general conduct of government; Political activities; Certain income payments; Construction of new housing (with some exceptions). 

Under the State CDBG Program, States may use $100,000 plus up to a maximum of three percent of its CDBG allocation. Amounts expended on administration in excess of $100,000 must be matched. States may expend up to three percent of their CDBG allocation on technical assistance activities. However, the total a state spends on both administrative and technical assistance expenses may not exceed $100,000 plus three percent of the state's allocation.

CPD has developed profiles that display grantee-reported accomplishments for selected housing, economic development, public improvement, and public service activities. Profiles for grantees will vary, as grantees have flexibility in determining the housing, economic, and community development activities they carry out with CDBG funds. The most recent accomplishments can be viewed within the National Accomplishment Reports located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg/cdbg-accomplishment-reports/; Expected Outcomes: The CDBG program reinforces several important values and principles of community development: program flexibility to empower people and communities to design and implement strategies tailored to their own needs and priorities; an emphasis on consolidated planning that expands and strengthens partnerships among all levels of government and the private sector in enhancing community development; technical assistance activities and set-aside for grantees to build the capacity of these partners. Each CDBG grantee’s expected outcomes are described as goals in their Consolidated Plan.  The most recent Consolidated Plans can be viewed at: https://www.hudexchange.info/grantees/reports/#consolidated-plans-annual-action-plans-and-capers; Intended Beneficiaries: Over a 1, 2, or 3-year period, as selected by the grantee, not less than 70 percent of CDBG funds must be used for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons. HUD does not provide CDBG assistance directly to individuals, businesses, nonprofit or organizations or other non-governmental entities. Individuals who are interested in participating in this program, should contact their local municipal or county officials to find out how the program operates in their community. Participation requirements may differ from one grantee to another. 

With the exception of the State CDBG Program, the local government grantee administers the CDBG program and determines which local projects receive funding. Eligible grantees are as follows: Principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs); Other metropolitan cities with populations of at least 50,000; Qualified urban counties with populations of at least 200,000 (excluding the population of entitled cities); States and insular areas.

The District of Columbia is funded under the CDBG Entitlement Program. The State of Hawaii does not participate, and HUD allocates the state's share of funds to the three Hawaii non-entitled counties. 

The States administer CDBG funds in the State CDBG Program. Since States are in the best position to know, and to respond to, the needs of local governments, Congress amended the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act) in 1981 to give each State the opportunity to administer CDBG funds for non-entitlement areas.; Subrecipient Activities: The subrecipient activities are unknown at the time of award.",14.218: COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS/ENTITLEMENT GRANTS,sub-grant,5FB80460-FCBD-11EF-9825-93915A4CF5B0,2025,1,FY25CDBG-08,200000.00,2024-07-22,2024,QB6JKS3L5E41,058903006,"METROPOLITAN BUSINESS LEAGUE OF RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, THE",RICHMOND FLYING SQUIRRELS,,,,USA,United States,1717 E CARY ST FL 1,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232237024,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESS,NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,BLACK AMERICAN OWNED",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232236935.0,VA-04,VA-04,USA,United States,"THROUGH MBL'S ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP TRAINING CDBG FUNDS WILL BE USED TO SUPPORT ENTREPRENEURIAL DEVELOPMENT, BUSINESS INCUBATION, BUSINESS EXPANSION, AND MARKETING AND BUSINESS ATTRACTION THROUGH ITS EXISTING PROGRAMS.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_B-24-MC-51-0019_086/,2025-01-10 00:00:00+00

Generally, non-entitlement areas are cities with populations of less than 50,000 (except cities that are designated principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas), and counties with populations of less than 200,000.

Current CDBG awards and allocations are included in this list of HUD Community Planning and Development (CPD) awards and allocations located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/GRANTEES/ALLOCATIONS-AWARDS/; Activities to be Performed: CDBG funds may be used for activities which include, but are not limited to: Acquisition of real property; Relocation and demolition; Rehabilitation of residential and non-residential structures; Construction of public facilities and improvements, such as water and sewer facilities, streets, neighborhood centers, and the conversion of school buildings for eligible purposes; Public services, within certain limits; Activities relating to energy conservation and renewable energy resources; Provision of assistance to profit-motivated businesses to carry out economic development and job creation/retention activities. Each activity must meet one of the following national objectives for the program: benefit low- and moderate-income persons, prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or address community development needs having a particular urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community for which other funding is not available. Generally, the following types of activities are ineligible: Acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of buildings for the general conduct of government; Political activities; Certain income payments; Construction of new housing (with some exceptions). 

Under the State CDBG Program, States may use $100,000 plus up to a maximum of three percent of its CDBG allocation. Amounts expended on administration in excess of $100,000 must be matched. States may expend up to three percent of their CDBG allocation on technical assistance activities. However, the total a state spends on both administrative and technical assistance expenses may not exceed $100,000 plus three percent of the state's allocation.

CPD has developed profiles that display grantee-reported accomplishments for selected housing, economic development, public improvement, and public service activities. Profiles for grantees will vary, as grantees have flexibility in determining the housing, economic, and community development activities they carry out with CDBG funds. The most recent accomplishments can be viewed within the National Accomplishment Reports located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg/cdbg-accomplishment-reports/; Expected Outcomes: The CDBG program reinforces several important values and principles of community development: program flexibility to empower people and communities to design and implement strategies tailored to their own needs and priorities; an emphasis on consolidated planning that expands and strengthens partnerships among all levels of government and the private sector in enhancing community development; technical assistance activities and set-aside for grantees to build the capacity of these partners. Each CDBG grantee’s expected outcomes are described as goals in their Consolidated Plan.  The most recent Consolidated Plans can be viewed at: https://www.hudexchange.info/grantees/reports/#consolidated-plans-annual-action-plans-and-capers; Intended Beneficiaries: Over a 1, 2, or 3-year period, as selected by the grantee, not less than 70 percent of CDBG funds must be used for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons. HUD does not provide CDBG assistance directly to individuals, businesses, nonprofit or organizations or other non-governmental entities. Individuals who are interested in participating in this program, should contact their local municipal or county officials to find out how the program operates in their community. Participation requirements may differ from one grantee to another. 

With the exception of the State CDBG Program, the local government grantee administers the CDBG program and determines which local projects receive funding. Eligible grantees are as follows: Principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs); Other metropolitan cities with populations of at least 50,000; Qualified urban counties with populations of at least 200,000 (excluding the population of entitled cities); States and insular areas.

The District of Columbia is funded under the CDBG Entitlement Program. The State of Hawaii does not participate, and HUD allocates the state's share of funds to the three Hawaii non-entitled counties.

The program is authorized under Title 1 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Public Law 93-383, as amended 42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq. The CDBG Program covers four distinct programs, each with their own set of governing regulations: CDBG Entitlement, CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii, CDBG Insular Areas, and State CDBG.

In the CDBG Entitlement Program, HUD awards grants to entitlement community grantees to carry out a wide range of community development activities. Entitlement communities develop their own programs and funding priorities.

In the CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii Program, three counties qualify: Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui. The FY 2004 Appropriations Act required the Governor of Hawaii to decide if the State wished to participate in the State CDBG program by July 31, 2004. The State made the decision not to participate in the program. As a result of this decision HUD's Honolulu Field Office administers the non-entitled grants in Hawaii. Funds are allocated using a formula based on population, poverty, and housing overcrowding, with the poverty factor carrying a double weight.

For the CDBG Insular Areas Program, HUD annually allocates CDBG grants to four designated areas: American Samoa; Guam; Northern Mariana Islands; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The funds are allocated in proportion to the populations of the eligible Territories. The program is administered by HUD's Field Offices in Puerto Rico and Hawaii.  

Under the State CDBG Program, States pass through CDBG grants to units of general local government. Annually, each State develops funding priorities and criteria for selecting projects. Since States are in the best position to know, and to respond to, the needs of local governments, Congress amended the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act) in 1981 to give each State the opportunity to administer CDBG funds for non-entitlement areas. Non-entitlement areas include those units of general local government which do not receive CDBG funds directly from HUD. Generally, non-entitlement areas are cities with populations of less than 50,000 (except cities that are designated principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas), and counties with populations of less than 200,000.

They often experience avoidable hospitalizations, adverse process-of-care outcomes, and aggressive care of minimal benefit at end-of-life. Additionally, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic added an unprecedented challenge to providing long-term care. One of the most significant initiatives designed to improve nursing home long-term care quality has been the institutional special needs plan (I-SNP), a specialized Medicare Advantage plan for long-term care residents authorized under the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act. Not only does capitated payment to I-SNPs reduce incentives to hospitalize residents, but the plans are adopt care models designed to increase coordination between the plan and the nursing home to improve primary care. We estimate that both the number of I-SNP plans and enrollees have more than doubled since 2012, and that 7% of all long-term nursing home residents with ADRD were enrolled in an I-SNP as of 2018. The overall objectives of this study are to assess the impact of I-SNP enrollment on long-term care quality for nursing home residents with ADRD both during the pre- and post-pandemic periods, understand factors contributing to I-SNP enrollment and growth, and characterize how I-SNP care practices influence resident outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that I-SNP enrollees with ADRD experience fewer hospitalizations and better care quality than enrollees in traditional fee-for-service Medicare or other MA plans due to comprehensive care management. To test these hypotheses and accomplish our objectives, we propose a mixed-methods study. The quantitative component involves quasi-experimental econometric analyses on a retrospective cohort of long-stay nursing home residents with ADRD using Medicare claims, electronic health record, and other administrative data. The qualitative analysis will obtain key insights from nursing home leaders on I-SNP performance, facilitators, and barriers. This project will produce a comprehensive, nationally representative portrait of I-SNP effectiveness in serving persons with ADRD residing in U.S. nursing homes. Findings will allow residents, families, nursing homes and other providers to make informed decisions about I-SNP enrollment and participation.",93.866: AGING RESEARCH,sub-grant,C23AE8F0-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,11,00002572,40325.00,2024-10-09,2025,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980203,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"DR.

THE DCR WILL IMPLEMENT A CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT WITH VCU FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTIST/ANALYST/PROGRAM MANAGER AND ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIALIST TO BE RETAINED THROUGH THE VCU LIFE SCIENCES DEPARTMENT AND THE RICE RIVERS CENTER TO SERVE AS THE HWP MANAGER AND HWP FIELD COORDINATOR. BOTH POSITIONS WILL BE HOUSED IN THE DCR NHP, HAVE ACCESS TO THE FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, VEHICLES, AND EXPERTISE OF DCR AND CONTINUE TO INTEGRATE THE SKILLS AND ABILITIES OF VCU. THE POSITIONS SERVE TO LIAISE BETWEEN DCR AND VCU TO PROMOTE JOINT, APPLIED RESEARCH, AND OUTREACH PROJECTS. FOR THE HWP MANAGER, THIS INCLUDES THE OVERSIGHT OF PROGRAMS, PROJECTS, GRANTS AND GRANT BUDGETS, PROVIDING TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO DCR NHP AND CZM, AS IT RELATES TO COASTAL ZONE ECOLOGY, MANAGEMENT, LAND CONSERVATION, AND RESTORATION ACTIVITIES. FOR THE HWP FIELD COORDINATOR, THIS INCLUDES WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE DCR NHP LAND CONSERVATION SECTION TO ADVANCE LAND CONSERVATION EFFORTS SUPPORTING ECOLOGICALLY HEALTHY AQUATIC RESOURCES AND BUILD ON-THE-GROUND CAPACITY THAT WILL LEAD TO LASTING CONSERVATION OF ECOLOGICALLY HEALTHY RESOURCES.  
VIRGINIA HAS COMMITTED TO A 2014 CHESAPEAKE BAY PROGRAM GOAL THAT 100 PERCENT OF STATE-IDENTIFIED, ECOLOGICALLY HEALTHY WATERS AND WATERSHEDS REMAIN HEALTHY, BY 2025. THIS GOAL WAS SET BY THE CHESAPEAKE BAY PROGRAM HEALTHY WATERSHEDS GOAL IMPLEMENTATION TEAM (GIT) AND FOR VIRGINIA IS BASED ON INSTAR DATA AND THE IDENTIFIED HEALTHY WATERSHEDS IN THE CHESAPEAKE BAY WATERSHED. TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL, THE DEVELOPMENT OF FIELD CAPACITY, COMBINED WITH RESOURCES FROM USEPA SECTION 319 AND CHESAPEAKE BAY IMPLEMENTATION GRANT (CBIG), WILL SUPPORT THE ON-THE-GROUND MEASURES NEEDED TO ADVANCE THOSE CONSERVATION ACTIONS FROM PLANNING TOOLS INTO TANGIBLE IMPLEMENTATION. SUCH MEASURES MAY INCLUDE THE APPLICATION OF AGRICULTURAL OR FORESTRY BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO MEET LOCAL TMDL WIP MEASURES IN IMPAIRED BUT ECOLOGICALLY HEALTHY WATERS. 
BOTH POSITIONS WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN STATE, LOCAL, OR FEDERAL WORK GROUPS AS NEEDED WITH REGARD TO WATER QUALITY PROTECTION AND RESTORATION ISSUES AS THE DCR DEEMS NECESSARY. IN ADDITION, THE HWP MANAGER WILL PREPARE SEMIANNUAL AND ANNUAL REPORTS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND INCLUDE THOSE ACTIONS BY THE HWP FIELD COORDINATOR IN THE COASTAL ZONE.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_NA23NOS4190255_013/,2023-11-28 00:00:00+00

THIS DATABASE CONSISTS OF TWO MAIN TYPES OF PARCELS:  THOSE ADJACENT TO EXISTING NAPS THAT HAVE A FORESEEABLE IMPACT ON THE LONGEVITY, PERSISTENCE, AND MANAGEABILITY OF THE NAP AND THEIR PROTECTED RESOURCES (CALLED ÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã…Â€ŒRESILIENCY TRACTS""); AND PARCELS KNOWN TO SUPPORT ONE OR MORE OCCURRENCES OF NHR CLASSIFIED AS ESSENTIAL BY AN ANALYSIS CONDUCTED BY VNHP WHERE LAND PROTECTION IS MOST URGENTLY NEEDED TO ESTABLISH NAP OR OTHER APPROPRIATE FORMS OF FORMAL DESIGNATION (CALLED ÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã…Â€ŒRESILIENCY AREAS"").  AN OCCURRENCE OF A NHR IS CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL IF IT IS THE ONLY EXTANT OCCURRENCE, OR ONE OF ONLY TWO EXTANT OCCURRENCES (FIVE EXTANT OCCURRENCES FOR THE MOST GLOBALLY RARE SPECIES), IN A REGION OR THE COMMONWEALTH.  ESSENTIAL OCCURRENCES OF NHR ARE USED TO IDENTIFY ESSENTIAL CONSERVATION SITES (ECS) AND A CUSTOM VERSION OF ECS FOR THE VIRGINIA COASTAL ZONE IS BEING DEVELOPED CURRENTLY UNDER NOAA GRANT NA22NOS4190187.  IN BOTH CASES, PARCELS MAY BE TARGETED FOR ACQUISITION OR FOR PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATIVE CONSERVATION STRATEGIES.  FURTHER WORK IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE WHICH OF THESE PARCELS WOULD BEST CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVERALL PROTECTED LANDS NETWORK IN LIGHT OF NEW RESILIENCE DETERMINATIONS.  THIS WORK IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL IN THE VIRGINIA COASTAL ZONE WHERE CHALLENGES FROM ONGOING AND PREDICTED SEA LEVEL RISE ARE EXTRAORDINARY.

THE KEY FOCUS OF THIS PROJECT IS TO FURTHER EVALUATE AND EXPAND ON RESILIENCY AREAS, NOT JUST FOR NAPS, BUT FOR OTHER STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT PROTECTED LANDS IN THE VIRGINIA COASTAL ZONE.  VNHP PROPOSES TO BUILD UPON THE STRATEGIC PLAN DEVELOPED AS THE CULMINATION OF THE FY2020-2022 FOCAL PROJECT (NOAA GRANTS: NA20NOS4190207, NA21NOS4190152, NA22NOS4190187; VNHP TECHNICAL REPORTS: 22-08, 23-03, TBD) BY ESTIMATING THE RESILIENCE CONTRIBUTION OF PARCELS ADJACENT TO OR NEARBY ALL PROTECTED LANDS IN THE VIRGINIA COASTAL ZONE THAT BOTH SUPPORT NHR AND ARE MANAGED AT LEAST FOR GENERAL NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION.   WHILE THE STRATEGIC PLAN ADDRESSES THE CONSERVATION OF THE MOST VULNERABLE AND HIGHEST PRIORITY NHR ON RESILIENT SITES, IT DOES NOT ADDRESS DIRECTLY HOW THE NAP SYSTEM COULD BE MOST EFFECTIVELY EXPANDED TO ENSURE RESILIENCE AT INDIVIDUAL SITES AND ACROSS THE NETWORK.  THERE ARE NEW TOOLS AVAILABLE THAT MAY LEAD TO MORE PRECISE PREDICTIONS OF RESILIENCE.  VNHP WILL EXPLORE USE OF THE MOST CURRENT AND ACCURATE DATA ON SEA LEVEL RISE, MARSH MIGRATION AND BUILDING, NATURAL LAND, SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS, SPECIES OBSERVATIONS, AND OTHER DATA, TO EXPAND AND UPDATE THE RESILIENCE DATASET AND FURTHER ILLUSTRATE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE DATA TO KNOWN NHRS.   VNHP WILL USE THESE RESULTS TO INFORM FUTURE CONSERVATION DECISIONS, EVEN IF THOSE DECISIONS ARE TO LET AVAILABLE LANDS GO UNPROTECTED BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOW LEVELS OF RESILIENCE AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO PERSIST.  THE RESULTS WILL GREATLY INFORM VNHP AND OUR PARTNER EFFORTS TO STRATEGICALLY FOCUS LIMITED FUNDING AND STEWARDSHIP RESOURCES. 

THE VNHP PROPOSES COLLABORATION WITH OTHER LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCIES (E.G., DWR, DOF, USFWS), NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS (E.G., TNC, CBF), AND AT LEAST ONE PLANNING DISTRICT COMMISSION (TO BE DETERMINED) TO ENSURE THAT PRIORITY LANDS WITH NHR ARE INCLUDED IN THE YEAR 1 ASSESSMENT.  IN YEAR 2 OF THIS PROJECT, THE VNHP PROPOSES CONDUCTING FIELD INVENTORY OF PROTECTED-LANDS ADJACENT, RESILIENT, AND HIGH PRIORITY PARCELS IDENTIFIED IN THIS YEAR 1 ASSESSMENT TO FURTHER GUIDE PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT DECISIONS.  IN YEAR 3 OF THIS PROJECT, THE VNHP PROPOSES ENTERING THE DATA COLLECTED DURING YEAR 2 INTO BIOTICS, VNHPÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã¢Â€ŽÂ¢S DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, AND THEN USING THE NAP RESILIENCE ANALYSIS AND UPDATED NHR INVENTORY DATA TO UPDATE THE STRATEGIC PLAN DEVELOPED UNDER THE FY2020-2022 FOCAL PROJECT.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_NA23NOS4190255_013/,2023-12-13 00:00:00+00

Stroke patients account for about 20% of all inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) admissions. However, there is limited research to date exploring patient-centered outcomes associated with the quality and intensity of IRF-based rehabilitation services among stroke patients who are racial/ethnic minorities and are dual eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Our proposal uses an integrative mixed methods design to study how individual- and provider-level factors contribute to disparities in IRF quality rating and amount of therapy, and subsequently, the combined effect of the two on patient health outcomes. The qualitative aim will identify facilitators and barriers to IRF selection among racial/ethnic minorities and those with dual eligiblility after stroke and the impact of the selection of quality IRFs on patient perceptions of IRF quality of care. This study will use 100% Medicare claims and assessment data (2017-2022), and perspectives from patients/caregivers, hospital discharge planners, and rehabilitation clinicians from different regions to understand selection processes of IRF and outcomes. We will utilize the Medicare Inpatient Standard Analytical File, Beneficiary Summary, Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities Patient Assessment Instrument, Provider of Service, and publicly available IRF Medicare compare data. Patients with ‘index stroke’ admitted directly to IRFs from acute hospitals will serve as our primary cohort. For the first three aims, a) change in functional status, b) 30-day hospital readmission, and c) community discharge will serve as primary outcomes, adjusting for patient-, hospital-, and market-level characteristics. For the fourth, qualitative aim, patient perception of IRF quality and perceived functional recovery will be primary dependent variables for assessing the impact of disparities in rehabilitation care.",93.307: MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES RESEARCH; 93.310: TRANS-NIH RESEARCH SUPPORT,sub-grant,CBA66C2A-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,6,10068440-01-VCU,175920.00,2024-03-29,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,RACE AND MEDICARE-MEDICAID DUAL ENROLLMENT DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO QUALITY AND INTENSITY OF POST-ACUTE REHABILITATION CARE AND HEALTH OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH STROKE,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R01MD017719_075/,2024-06-06 00:00:00+00

Neural circuits must operate with quick, momentary sensorimotor responses (~10 ms), but also maintain persistent activity for short-term memory (~10000 ms), and many other timescales between these extremes. Depending on behavioral context, faster or slower timescales may be more useful, but there is no single most-important timescale. The status quo in computational neuroscience is to pick one particular function (usually associated with one, or a few particular timescales) and then build theory and experiments which address it. While useful, this cottage industry approach leaves open an important knowledge gap; we lack a unified theory that accounts holistically for the many timescales that coexist in real cortical circuits. How can a single, local population of cortical neurons generate dynamics with a broad repertoire of coexistent timescales? How is the repertoire of timescales tuned to accommodate behavioral context? Here we propose to develop fundamental theory and data analytic tools to answer these questions and to directly test important hypotheses in awake mice. Our preliminary theoretical efforts and experimental data strongly support the following hypotheses which frame our proposed work. Central hypothesis 1: Neural populations in awake cortex manifest with a very broad repertoire of timescales because they operate near criticality, which is a dynamical regime defined by an infinite range of scale-invariant timescales. Central hypothesis 2: Changes in arousal and behavior tune the cortical operating regime around criticality, allowing the system to shift the repertoire of timescales to be faster or slower. Our proposed work will be organized into four specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a temporal renormalization group theory (tRG) for describing and explaining the origins of multiple timescales in local cortical population spike recordings. Our theory will build upon traditional RG from physics, but specifically modified for spatially local, high-density recordings with single cell resolution. In Aim 2, we will generate an easy-access data analysis toolbox for investigating the timescale repertoire of spike recordings. In Aim 3, we will determine how timescale repertoire shifts with vigilance and behavioral context. In Aim 4, we will identify biophysical mechanisms which impact the timescale repertoire. Our theory and tools will perform fair comparisons of multiple competing theories (criticality and others) based on a holistic view of cortical timescales.

Stroke patients account for about 20% of all inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) admissions. However, there is limited research to date exploring patient-centered outcomes associated with the quality and intensity of IRF-based rehabilitation services among stroke patients who are racial/ethnic minorities and are dual eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Our proposal uses an integrative mixed methods design to study how individual- and provider-level factors contribute to disparities in IRF quality rating and amount of therapy, and subsequently, the combined effect of the two on patient health outcomes. The qualitative aim will identify facilitators and barriers to IRF selection among racial/ethnic minorities and those with dual eligiblility after stroke and the impact of the selection of quality IRFs on patient perceptions of IRF quality of care. This study will use 100% Medicare claims and assessment data (2017-2022), and perspectives from patients/caregivers, hospital discharge planners, and rehabilitation clinicians from different regions to understand selection processes of IRF and outcomes. We will utilize the Medicare Inpatient Standard Analytical File, Beneficiary Summary, Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities Patient Assessment Instrument, Provider of Service, and publicly available IRF Medicare compare data. Patients with ‘index stroke’ admitted directly to IRFs from acute hospitals will serve as our primary cohort.

Little is known about the influence of inhaled environmental pollutants, such as from wildfire smoke (WFS) exposure, on molecular pathways governing cerebrovascular and neurological aging in the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia. Yet, parallel molecular changes are induced by aging and inhaled toxicants within the blood, raising the potential for their negative interaction. This includes increased metalloproteinases, serpins and inflammatory factors that can directly promote age-related neurological pathologies. Moreover, our research documents how inhaled pollutants cause blood compositional changes, particularly as protease-induced peptides, that promote vascular dysfunction and neurological inflammation. Inhaled toxicant induced circulating factors promote blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeation, glial activation and pro-inflammatory secretion and recruitment, and elevation of AD markers such as amyloid beta. Inhaled toxicant and age-related BBB deficits and associated sequelae show common involvement for vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), which is directly increased on cerebrovascular endothelial cells following exposure to WFS. Thus, we hypothesize that WFS augments pathological aging outcomes of senescence- associated secretory proteins in the circulating milieu to advance BBB compromise, neuroinflammation, and prime AD pathogenesis principally through expression/activity of cerebrovascular VCAM-1. To test this hypothesis, our team proposes the following aims: 1. Assess interaction between WFS exposure-induced and aging-related circulatory changes as drivers of BBB impairment, neuroinflammation, and early evidence of amyloid and tau proteinopathy. Serum compositional changes caused by aging x WFS exposure will be comprehensively assessed at the protein, peptide and metabolite levels and paired with in vivo histopathology and functional ex vivo phenotyping of major hallmarks of neurological and cardiovascular aging. 2. Delineate the role of cerebrovascular endothelial receptors, namely CD36, as intermediates in WFS-induced neuroinflammation. CD36 is clearly involved in acute responses of the BBB to inhaled toxicants, and likely to upregulation of VCAM-1, which has been recently implicated as a mediator of aging-related neurological sequelae. 3. Pharmacologically attenuate accelerated aging from WFS exposure using a sirtuin-1 activator (resveratrol) with an NAD+ booster (NMN) and/or a senolytic cocktail to reduce aging-related circulating factors. These permutations will target the key outcomes of circulatory changes from WFS exposure in target cells (vascular, neural) to reduce early pro-AD pathogenic BBB compromise, neuroinflammation and proteinopathy related outcomes. Together, findings will detail the influence of WFS in advancing age-related AD pathogenesis by generating vascular-compromising and glial-stimulating factors in the circulation, and evaluate counteracting therapeutics for use following unavoidable WFS exposure.",93.866: AGING RESEARCH,sub-grant,C20AF26C-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,3,3RMC9/3MC90,271688.00,2024-03-20,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232843035.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"ONGOING COLLABORATION BETWEEN OUR LABS IS REVEALING A CASCADING MOLECULAR RESPONSE INITIATED BY XENOBIOTIC PULMONARY EXPOSURE, RELEASING BIOACTIVE FACTORS INTO THE LUNG AND ACROSS THE BARRIER ON INTO THE CIRCULATION WHERE THE SYSTEMIC EXPOSURE GAINS THE NUMBER OF FACTORS IN THE BLOOD, ALTERING THE BALANCE OF NEGATIVE AND COMPENSATORY FACTORS.

Stroke patients account for about 20% of all inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) admissions. However, there is limited research to date exploring patient-centered outcomes associated with the quality and intensity of IRF-based rehabilitation services among stroke patients who are racial/ethnic minorities and are dual eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Our proposal uses an integrative mixed methods design to study how individual- and provider-level factors contribute to disparities in IRF quality rating and amount of therapy, and subsequently, the combined effect of the two on patient health outcomes. The qualitative aim will identify facilitators and barriers to IRF selection among racial/ethnic minorities and those with dual eligiblility after stroke and the impact of the selection of quality IRFs on patient perceptions of IRF quality of care. This study will use 100% Medicare claims and assessment data (2017-2022), and perspectives from patients/caregivers, hospital discharge planners, and rehabilitation clinicians from different regions to understand selection processes of IRF and outcomes. We will utilize the Medicare Inpatient Standard Analytical File, Beneficiary Summary, Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities Patient Assessment Instrument, Provider of Service, and publicly available IRF Medicare compare data. Patients with ‘index stroke’ admitted directly to IRFs from acute hospitals will serve as our primary cohort. For the first three aims, a) change in functional status, b) 30-day hospital readmission, and c) community discharge will serve as primary outcomes, adjusting for patient-, hospital-, and market-level characteristics. For the fourth, qualitative aim, patient perception of IRF quality and perceived functional recovery will be primary dependent variables for assessing the impact of disparities in rehabilitation care.",93.307: MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES RESEARCH; 93.310: TRANS-NIH RESEARCH SUPPORT,sub-grant,CBA668F6-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2025,2,10068440-01-VCU,173290.00,2025-02-20,2025,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005.0,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,RACE AND MEDICARE-MEDICAID DUAL ENROLLMENT DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO QUALITY AND INTENSITY OF POST-ACUTE REHABILITATION CARE AND HEALTH OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH STROKE,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R01MD017719_075/,2025-02-26 00:00:00+00

The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are more complex than a mere decrease in ATP pro- duction and very little is known about these complex processes in a tissue-specific manner. There is thus an urgent unmet need to assess the impact of the widespread mitochondrial dysfunction in multiple tissues leading to MIMODS. We have demonstrated deleterious outcomes of widespread mitochondrial dysfunction (lowered bioenergetics health index, abnormal mitochondrial morphology, elevated putrescine levels) in multiple pediat- ric PMD dermal fibroblasts carrying unique pathogenic mtDNA variants. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that elevated putrescine levels cause oxidative stress response and widespread mitochondrial dysfunction that contributes to MIMODS in cellular models of primary mitochondrial disorders. Our collaborative team will de- sign experiments and build upon established expertise in mitochondrial genetics and physiology, stem cell biol- ogy and differentiation, next-generation sequencing analysis and metabolite profiling to address the following research aims: In Aim 1, we will comprehensively assess mitochondrial dysfunction in twenty pediatric diseased fibroblasts with a confirmed diagnosis of PMDs, along with five age matched controls. We will assess the oxida- tive stress markers, NAD/NADH redox biochemistry, metabolomics, mitochondrial respiration and morphology. In aim 2, we will seek to understand tissue-specific abnormalities associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons, cardiomyocytes and podocytes. In aim 3, we will assess the effect of targeted interventions of reducing oxidative stress and improving mitochondrial respiration in multiple differentiated cell types that exhibit ele- vated putrescine levels; and in multiple tissues from preclinical mouse models of PMD. The completion of these aims will contribute to a newer understanding of putrescine metabolism in multiple energy-intensive cell types derived from patients with pediatric PMD and its role in triggering MIMODS. In the long-term, our studies have the potential to develop strategies for individualized testing of patient cells with candidate therapeutics to drive rational, personalized therapies.",93.865: CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH,sub-grant,C988F098-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2023,11,UA2024-408,213436.00,2023-11-27,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232840568.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"SCOPE OF WORK

Within Arkansas, place- and race-based disparities are quite profound, and rural residents and Blacks/African Americans fare the worst. Forty one- percent of Arkansans live in rural areas where socioeconomic distress, chronic disease risk factors, and social structural factors underlying these disparities have not changed in decades. Poverty and food insecurity are higher, and wages, employment opportunities and health care access are lower in rural than in urban Arkansas. Blacks/African Americans have the highest cancer and CVD mortality rates, the worst socioeconomic indicators, and have experienced enormous historic trauma, particularly in the Delta regions. To address this historical embedment of place- and race-based health inequities in Arkansas, the proposed Center for Research, Health, and Social Justice (CRHS) will use a social justice framework to inform the development and implementation of a robust process for advancing novel multilevel and transdisciplinary research, engaging communities in equitable partnerships to address the root causes of chronic disease disparities, and building, training and mentoring a diverse and competent research workforce prepared to eliminate disparities in cancer and CVD. Our social justice framework will help the CRHS identify interconnected patterns of systematic disadvantage in the community and in our research ecosystem to inform how the cores, research projects, advisory boards, and our broad-based coalition of academic and community partners can work synergistically to accomplish CRHS goals. Our coalition of stakeholders includes partners in the Northwest, Highlands and Delta regions of Arkansas and multiple institutional partners integrated into the cores and research projects who will employ common measures, tools, methods, and approaches to accomplish the CRHS goals. The CRHS will work with the NIMHD Chronic Disease Disparities Coordinating Center to leverage and share resources, engage in cutting-edge cross center research, and increase networking and research opportunities for new investigators. The CRHS will leverage multiple federally-funded resources including the Clinical Translational Science Award program, the National Research Mentoring Network, federally funded center grants, and federal surveys to help facilitate research, training, mentoring, dissemination, and translation of research to inform public practice and policy.

Our coalition of stakeholders includes partners in the Northwest, Highlands and Delta regions of Arkansas and multiple institutional partners integrated into the cores and research projects who will employ common measures, tools, methods, and approaches to accomplish the CRHS goals. The CRHS will work with the NIMHD Chronic Disease Disparities Coordinating Center to leverage and share resources, engage in cutting-edge cross center research, and increase networking and research opportunities for new investigators. The CRHS will leverage multiple federally-funded resources including the Clinical Translational Science Award program, the National Research Mentoring Network, federally funded center grants, and federal surveys to help facilitate research, training, mentoring, dissemination, and translation of research to inform public practice and policy. CRHS builds on our prior successes and will create a robust research ecosystem that serves as a national model for eliminating chronic disease disparities by using a social justice framework for research, training, and community engagement.",93.307: MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES RESEARCH,sub-grant,BDFD3A9A-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,11,55510-03S1,528786.00,2024-09-24,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980568,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,PROJECT 4: BLACK HEALTH QUIT AND SCREEN PROJECT,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_P50MD017319_075/,2024-11-01 00:00:00+00

Comprehensive interdisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation can maximize function and reduce complications. However, clinicians and researchers are unable to answer the question, “Which of the wide range of rehabilitation practices can most effectively advance recovery and improve outcomes?” Due to the complexity of the rehabilitation process and the heterogeneity of the TBI patient population, the standard approach to comparative effectiveness research, the randomized controlled trial, is inadequate. Nevertheless, with growing limitations on healthcare resources and shorter lengths of stay, it is urgent and critical to identify the specific rehabilitation approaches that can optimize outcomes for persons with TBI.  A pragmatic, prospective observational study to close this evidence gap is proposed. By leveraging the infrastructure of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research’s TBI Model Systems, the largest longitudinal study of moderate-severe TBI in the world, the data needed to compare the effectiveness of different rehabilitation approaches will quickly accumulate. Recent advances in data capture, through electronic medical records (EMR), and in advanced statistical methods provide the avenue by which the complexity of rehabilitation can be scientifically studied. Aim 1: This study aims to leverage EMR technology to ensure data identified as critical to rehabilitation treatment are captured through standardized documentation during the natural course of a patient’s hospitalization. Aim 2: Incorporating the findings of preliminary studies on comparative effectiveness of treatment approaches, this study will aim to evaluate the impact of different approaches to treatment on patient outcomes. It is hypothesized that rehabilitation interventions directly targeting performance of real-life activities (ContextTx) and higher-level functions (AdvTx) will individually and in combination improve community participation at 1-year post-injury, as well as on functional independence at discharge and at 1-year post-injury. Aim 3: Identify time-varying patient and setting factors that can change over the course of rehabilitation and that modify the effects of treatment.

Comprehensive interdisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation can maximize function and reduce complications. However, clinicians and researchers are unable to answer the question, “Which of the wide range of rehabilitation practices can most effectively advance recovery and improve outcomes?” Due to the complexity of the rehabilitation process and the heterogeneity of the TBI patient population, the standard approach to comparative effectiveness research, the randomized controlled trial, is inadequate. Nevertheless, with growing limitations on healthcare resources and shorter lengths of stay, it is urgent and critical to identify the specific rehabilitation approaches that can optimize outcomes for persons with TBI.  A pragmatic, prospective observational study to close this evidence gap is proposed. By leveraging the infrastructure of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research’s TBI Model Systems, the largest longitudinal study of moderate-severe TBI in the world, the data needed to compare the effectiveness of different rehabilitation approaches will quickly accumulate. Recent advances in data capture, through electronic medical records (EMR), and in advanced statistical methods provide the avenue by which the complexity of rehabilitation can be scientifically studied. Aim 1: This study aims to leverage EMR technology to ensure data identified as critical to rehabilitation treatment are captured through standardized documentation during the natural course of a patient’s hospitalization. Aim 2: Incorporating the findings of preliminary studies on comparative effectiveness of treatment approaches, this study will aim to evaluate the impact of different approaches to treatment on patient outcomes. It is hypothesized that rehabilitation interventions directly targeting performance of real-life activities (ContextTx) and higher-level functions (AdvTx) will individually and in combination improve community participation at 1-year post-injury, as well as on functional independence at discharge and at 1-year post-injury. Aim 3: Identify time-varying patient and setting factors that can change over the course of rehabilitation and that modify the effects of treatment.  Advanced statistical analyses coupled with data capture made feasible by effectively designed EMR documentation from frontline providers will provide the data necessary to identify which treatment approaches are associated with better patient outcomes. This in turn will arm clinical providers with valuable knowledge to design the most effective treatment plans for patients.

Awareness of a positive result can inform treatment decisions for cancer patients and risk management plans in both cancer survivors and women unaffected with cancer. The slow translation of guidelines into practice particularly impacts minority populations who receive services in community health clinics. Latina women have lower awareness and use of genetic counseling and testing (GCT) than non-Latina Whites. Latinas face multiple health care, pragmatic, and psychosocial barriers to GCT uptake. Latinas prefer culturally targeted interventions in Spanish with plain language, visual aids, and a narrative format. We developed a culturally targeted narrative video in Spanish for at-risk Latinas. Piloted in a single-arm trial (N=40), Latinas reported high satisfaction and exhibited a significant increase in knowledge from pre- to post-test. Nearly all participants (95%) reported an interest in GCT, and 62% completed genetic counseling. We will use an innovative hybrid research design that combines elements of traditional efficacy studies as well as best practices from implementation research to enhance the quality and speed of the translational process. Guided by an expanded Integrated Behavioral Model, we will conduct a RCT to evaluate the efficacy of our video vs. the FORCE fact sheet on enhancing GCT uptake and psychosocial outcomes. To maximize the potential for implementation in community clinics, we will train clinic staff to administer the Referral Screening Tool (RST), a validated tool to identify women at-risk of HBOC. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we will conduct an Implementation Focused Process Evaluation to gather data on clinic implementation outcomes for use of the Referral Screening Tool and the video. We will refer participants to free Spanish telephone genetic counseling. We will randomize 300 at-risk Latinas at four sites with large Latinx populations. Our primary outcome is genetic counseling uptake. Aim 1. Evaluate the impact of our video vs. fact sheet on GCT uptake. Participants in the video arm will have higher genetic counseling uptake (H1.1.) and higher genetic testing uptake (H1.2.) at 4 months. Aim 2. Evaluate the impact of our video vs. fact sheet on psychosocial and process evaluation outcomes. H2.1: Video participants will have higher knowledge, positive attitudes, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and positive anticipatory emotions. H2.2. Video participants will have higher acceptability and feasibility ratings. Exploratory aim: Evaluate mechanisms of the video's impact on genetic counseling uptake (knowledge, attitudes, norms, self-efficacy, anticipatory emotions). If counseling uptake does not differ by arm, then we will evaluate predictors of uptake. Aim 3. Examine key implementation outcomes of feasibility, acceptability, adoption, fidelity, and future sustainability of using the Referral Screening Tool and the video at the community clinics.",93.393: CANCER CAUSE AND PREVENTION RESEARCH,sub-grant,C4EE364C-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,8,424855_GR424471-VCU,69861.00,2024-08-19,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980568,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"THE GOAL OF THIS GRANT IS TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF A CULTURALLY

MDD is the commonest psychiatric disorder and recognized as the world’s leading cause of disability, yet current treatments are relatively ineffective: only about half of patients will show signs of improvement after three months of therapy. Genetic approaches are a proven path to identifying causal factors and hence finding novel treatments, but they are hard to apply to MDD without obtaining large samples of cases. We propose using the very large numbers of cases available through electronic medical records by applying statistical methods that accurately identify MDD. Our methods provide a “best-guess” diagnosis by a process known as imputation. We then identify features that are specific to MDD. Our insight is that since non-genetic and non-specific factors explain large components of variability in traditional MDD phenotypes, algorithmically removing them increases the signal from the core biological drivers. We assume that non-specificity can be attributed to latent factors capturing the relationship between MDD, comorbid disease, and pleiotropic factors. By identifying and removing these signals, we increase specificity, and thus identify features that reflect the episodic severe shifts of mood, associated with neurovegetative and cognitive changes, that are central to MDD. Our project has three aims: first, to impute phenotypes of a large sample of MDD cases and controls in biobank data and determine the best approximation to MDD; second, to identify and characterise specific and non-specific genetic effects on MDD, and finally to identify genes involved in MDD by associating the cases defined via our first two aims with rare coding variants.",93.242: MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH GRANTS,sub-grant,CCB04DB6-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,8,20000000114452,109689.00,2024-07-10,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849040.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"IN THIS STUDY, DR, KENDLER WILL SEEK TO FIND RARE GENETIC VARIANTS THAT IMPACT ON RISK FOR MAJOR DEPRESSION (MD).

AUD and PTSD frequently co-occur, and comorbidity is associated with a host of negative clinical outcomes, including greater symptom severity, poorer treatment prognosis, suicidal ideation, and poor physical health. Mechanisms of comorbidity remain largely unknown, but shared risk in the form of overlapping genetic etiology may play a role. AUD and PTSD are moderately heritable, overlap in latent genetic risk, and are genetically correlated in large GWAS studies (rG=0.35), particularly among women. In addition to genetic risk, trauma exposure may be a shared risk factor for adult AUD and PTSD, the impact of which may be exacerbated by genetic risk. However, the mechanisms by which trauma increases risk need to be identified. Preliminary evidence suggests that childhood trauma impacts brain development (i.e., atypical EEG activity observed during adolescence and young adulthood), which in turn increases risk for AUD and PTSD. Effects were more robust among females and those with a family history of AUD. Despite these promising findings, little is known about the influence of trauma on adolescent and young adult brain development and risk for AUD and PTSD, and no other studies have examined these factors together in a longitudinal paradigm, leaving the complex interactions among childhood trauma, polygenic, and neurodevelopmental risk for AUD and PTSD poorly understood. The present study will fill these gaps in the literature in a highly translational set of aims. Building of the research team’s prior work, this study will assess the impact of childhood trauma on longitudinal trajectories of brain functioning (i.e., EEG functional connectivity) and risk for adult AUD and PTSD using data from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism’s prospective study. Next, using summary statistics from the largest genome wide association studies (GWAS) on AUD, AUD-related phenotypes (e.g., alcohol use behaviors) and PTSD, we will elucidate the genetic factor structure of these phenotypes. A novel multivariate genetic method, genomic Structural Equation Modeling (gSEM), will be used to determine the factor structure, and the resulting best-fit model will be used to produce polygenic risk scores (PRS) that index shared genetic risk between the phenotypes (e.g., AUD-PTSD), as well as unique risk for each condition. Finally, these PRS indexing risk unique and common for AUD-PTSD will be integrated into the longitudinal analyses of childhood trauma, EEG functional connectivity, and risk for adult AUD and PTSD. Important sex differences will also be examined. Results from this study will shed light on these important public health conditions and will yield important implications for prevention and intervention efforts.",93.273: ALCOHOL RESEARCH PROGRAMS; 93.866: AGING RESEARCH,sub-grant,BF559A04-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2023,12,100-1177113-95213,175528.00,2023-11-10,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980568,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY (VCU) WILL SUPPORT ANALYSES OF LARGE GWAS DATA FOR AIM 1 AND

When individuals become dislocated workers because of job loss, mass layoffs, global trade dynamics or transitions in economic sectors, the WIOA DW program provides services to assist them in reentering the workforce.Activities to be performed: WIOA specifies that most DW services will be provided through the American Job Center network, also known as one-stop career centers. Under the DW program, eligible individuals will receive career services, which are classified into two categories: basic and individualized services. While some job seekers may only needself-service or other basic career services such as labor exchange services, others may needmore comprehensive services, such as individualized services, which include career planning, and developing an individual employment plan outlining needs and goals of the job seeker. Participants will also receive training services linked to job opportunities in their communities. To promote customer choice and involvement in career decisions, participants use an Individual Training Account to select an appropriate training program from an eligible training provider list. WIOA also authorizes the provision of supportive services (e.g. transportation and child care assistance) to enable an individual to participate in the program.Expected Outcomes: The WIOA Dislocated Worker program outcomes are to ensure that individuals can access and receive the employment and training services they are eligible for, so that they may become employed or advance in employment. Grantees report performance measures of these outcomes, including the percentage of people employed in the second and fourth quarter after finishing.Intended beneficiaries: Individuals who lose their jobs because of layoffs, global trade dynamics, or other economic transitions, such individuals who have received a notice of termination or layoff from employment, including a separation notice from active military services.

Through cooperative agreements, OVW supports educational initiatives, conferences, peer-to-peer consultations, and targeted assistance that allow current and potential grantees and subgrantees to learn from experts and one another about how to overcome obstacles and incorporate promising practices in their efforts to address violence against women. In addition, OVW is focused on building the capacity of the criminal and civil justice systems and victim service organizations to respond effectively to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking and to foster partnerships between organizations that have not traditionally worked together to address violence against women.

With FY 2023 TA Initiative funding, AEquitas will implement the Just Tech: Investigation and Prosecution of Online Abuse project. This project will provide training and technical assistance to law enforcement and prosecutors on the issue of online abuse- cyberstalking, doxing, online harassment, and image exploitation.

HCC has an atypical presentation in Blacks, with lower cirrhosis stage at the time of HCC diagnosis and more advanced and aggressive HCC. Blacks have higher exposure to environmental pollutants than Whites and these exposures are associated with liver damage. Although heavy metals and toxins are known to cause liver injury and cancer, they are often overlooked. This project addresses the need to understand the genomic and environmental factors causing the atypical presentation of HCC in Blacks so that effective prevention and treatment strategies can be implemented. It is responsive to RFA-CA- 23-023 in the topic area: Liver cancer in underserved minority populations. This innovative collaboration between experts in the Liver Cirrhosis Network and liver cancer researchers is expected to yield actionable mechanistic insights into environmental exposures, tumor immunophenotype, and genetic factors driving the atypical presentation of HCC in Blacks and may identify new targets for intervention and prevention. The study will also yield a polygenic risk score for cirrhosis for use among ancestrally diverse populations. The results will alert patients and providers to the fact that HCC risk is disproportionate to cirrhosis stage in Blacks, raising awareness of the threat and encouraging early enrollment in surveillance. This project will expand HCC tumor sequencing and transcriptomic data from Black patients over 4-fold. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has only 17 HCCs from Blacks. Aim I: Hypothesis: Mutational signatures of toxic damage are more prevalent in HCCs of Blacks than in HCCs of Whites. We will perform whole exome sequencing on paired HCC/non-HCC specimens from Blacks and use our in-house pipeline to identify somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), to find known and novel mutational signatures, to define the tumor mutational burden, and to identify mutated genes. Aim II: Hypothesis: The HCC tumor cells and surrounding microenvironment in Blacks are primed for pro-tumor activity. We will perform global transcriptomic analysis on paired HCC/non-HCC specimens of Blacks to identify oncogenic drivers and computationally immunophenotype the microenvironment. Multiplexed IHC will be used to map the molecular findings onto the histological architecture of the patient's human liver specimens. Aim III: Hypothesis: Blacks with HCC have a lower prevalence of cirrhosis risk variants than Whites with HCC, but they have a high prevalence of cancer risk variants, including rare penetrant variants. We will compare the prevalence of cancer predisposition variants in Blacks with HCC vs. healthy controls, develop score cirrhosis a polygenic risk for cirrhosis, compare cirrhosis risk between Blacks and Whites with HCC, and explore genetic risks for in study subjects in the Liver Cirrhosis Network who develop HCC.",93.396: CANCER BIOLOGY RESEARCH,sub-grant,2121869E-FCD2-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,11,0255-I661-4609,166854.00,2023-11-21,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849040,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"YEAR 1: 0255-I661-4609

Recent conceptualizations of child behavior disorders classify these diagnoses as neurodevelopmental conditions, which suggests unexplored prenatal and early life origins. The proposed study will test the premise that child behavior dysregulation emerges, in part, from prenatal exposures to disrupted maternal sleep and emotion dysregulation—a transdiagnostic indicator of psychopathology. Data from our laboratories provide evidence that exposure to maternal emotion dysregulation associates with neurodevelopmental differences in newborn arousal and attention, as measured within hours after birth. Additional pilot analyses reveal that this blunted neurodevelopmental profile associates with behavior problems at 18 months. A goal of this study is to explore whether early sleep difficulties function as a behavioral mechanism connecting infant neurodevelopmental profiles to toddler attention and behavior dysregulation at 12 months. Sleep is a foundational health behavior and one of the earliest dyadic/family-based regulatory processes. We propose an innovative design for measuring maternal, paternal, and infant sleep variability, defined as inconsistency in hours slept per night, using a longitudinal burst design. Sleep will be assessed via actigraphy and research-validated consumer devices during the 2nd and 3rd trimester, week 1 after birth, then months 4, 6, 9, and 12. We aim to test whether (1) prenatal exposure to maternal emotion dysregulation, chronotype, and sleep variability predicts infant neurodevelopment and maternal-infant sleep variability; (2) infant neurodevelopment interacts with environmental sleep structure (e.g., bedtime routines) to affect infant sleep variability over time; and (3) infant sleep trajectories characterized by high variability (i.e., failure to attain normative stability) will mediate associations between neurodevelopmental profiles and toddler attention and behavior dysregulation. An exploratory aim will incorporate direct and indirect influences of partners on maternal and infant sleep. To accomplish these innovative aims, we will use established protocols to enroll women in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy (N=200 women) along a uniform distribution of emotion dysregulation, and their partners. This technique overrepresents women with high dysregulation and increases statistical power. Women, partners, and infants will then be followed for the first 12 months after birth using techniques that minimize burden, due to passive monitoring and brief surveys. This study builds upon rigorous prior research, including work from our own NIH-funded projects, to delve into the crucial challenge of infant sleep. The study unites a stellar team, with expertise in maternal emotion dysregulation, infant neurodevelopment, adult and infant sleep, longitudinal designs, and toddler attention and behavior dysregulation.

Ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS) has been the standard treatment for >60 years but shunts remain highly problematic, with an unacceptably high malfunction rate and often lead to a lifetime of complex neurosurgical care. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an alternative to shunting but has limited efficacy in infants. Adding choroid plexus cauterization (CPC) to ETV seems to be a viable alternative to shunting infants. Despite conflicting outcomes, ETV-CPC is currently being offered routinely and globally, and with limited understanding of the risks or benefits of this procedure on brain development. The lack of knowledge about both the surgical and physiological consequences of ETV-CPC constitutes a significant barrier to broad acceptance of this procedure. For example, the impact of ablating the choroid plexus, a major homeostatic organ which regulates neurogenesis and neurodevelopment, has yet to be determined. Experimental studies are needed to determine the role of ETV and ETV-CPC in clinical practice, but the lack of appropriate, validated large animal models in which to test these techniques on brain physiology and, critically, on brain development, has never been studied. Our hypothesis-driven proposal builds on our foundational work that developed a large, clinically-relevant animal model of HC in juvenile domestic pigs and demonstrated feasibility of ETV+CPC, and VPS, thus continuing the goals of NIH PA-180-623, “Tools to Enhance the Study of Prenatal and Pediatric Hydrocephalus”.

Supporting these aims are published and preliminary data showing cytopathology in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and periventricular white matter (PVWM) following treatment with VPS and ETV+CPC, ventricular zone (VZ) disruption, SVZ/PVWM cell death, glial activation, and heterotopia, PVWM glial activation and reduced oligodendrocyte progenitors, flow cytometry and single cell RNA sequencing differences in microglia and precursor lineages, CSF cellular and protein alterations, and reduced cognitive assessments. Analyses will be performed at 30- and 90-days post-treatment.

OVERVIEW OF PROJECT:
HYDROCEPHALUS (HC) IS A COMMON AND DEBILITATING NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION AFFECTING UP TO 1 IN 500 INDIVIDUALS. VENTRICULOPERITONEAL SHUNTING (VPS) HAS BEEN THE STANDARD TREATMENT FOR >60 YEARS BUT SHUNTS REMAIN HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC, WITH AN UNACCEPTABLY HIGH MALFUNCTION RATE, AND OFTEN LEAD TO A LIFETIME OF COMPLEX NEUROSURGICAL CARE. ENDOSCOPIC THIRD VENTRICULOSTOMY WITH CHOROID PLEXUS CAUTERIZATION (ETV+CPC) IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SHUNTING BUT HAS LIMITED EFFICACY IN INFANTS. THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT BOTH THE SURGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF ETV-CPC CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO THE BROAD ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PROCEDURE. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF ETV AND ETV+CPC IN CLINICAL PRACTICE, BUT THE LACK OF APPROPRIATE VALIDATED LARGE ANIMAL MODELS IN WHICH TO TEST THESE TECHNIQUES ON BRAIN PHYSIOLOGY AND, CRITICALLY, ON BRAIN DEVELOPMENT, HAS NEVER BEEN STUDIED.
OUR HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN PROPOSAL BUILDS ON OUR FOUNDATIONAL WORK THAT DEVELOPED A LARGE, CLINICALLY-RELEVANT ANIMAL MODEL OF HC IN JUVENILE DOMESTIC PIGS AND DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF ETV+CPC, AND VPS. THREE SPECIFIC AIMS WILL TEST OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT, COMPARED WITH VPS, ETV+CPC IMPAIRS BRAIN DEVELOPMENT THROUGH DISRUPTION OF VENTRICULAR ZONE (VZ) AND PERIVENTRICULAR WHITE MATTER (PVWM) PRECURSOR BIOLOGY AND CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) HOMEOSTASIS WITH PRO-INFLAMMATORY SIGNALING: AIM 1 - COMPARE THE CYTOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF VPS AND ETV+CPC ON VZ AND PVWM; AIM 2 - DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF VPS AND ETV+CPC ON CHOROID PLEXUS AND CSF PROFILE; AIM 3 - COMPARE NEUROBEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE OUTCOMES IN HC ANIMALS TREATED WITH VPS AND ETV+CPC. SUPPORTING THESE AIMS ARE PUBLISHED AND PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWING CYTOPATHOLOGY IN THE VZ AND PVWM FOLLOWING TREATMENT WITH VPS AND ETV+CPC, VZ/PVWM CELL DEATH, GLIAL ACTIVATION, AND HETEROTOPIA, PVWM GLIAL ACTIVATION AND REDUCED OLIGODENDROCYTE PROGENITORS, FLOW CYTOMETRY AND SINGLE-CELL RNA SEQUENCING DIFFERENCES IN MICROGLIA AND PRECURSOR LINEAGES, CSF CELLULAR AND PROTEIN ALTERATIONS, AND REDUCED COGNITIVE ASSESSMENTS. ANALYSES WILL BE PERFORMED AT 30- AND 90-DAYS POST-TREATMENT. PIGS WERE CHOSEN FOR THESE EXPERIMENTS BECAUSE OF THEIR CLOSE HOMOLOGY TO HUMAN NEUROANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY AND THE ABILITY TO USE STANDARD CLINICAL NEUROSURGICAL TECHNIQUES. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL FILL A CRITICAL VOID IN HC RESEARCH THROUGH RIGOROUS TESTING OF EMERGING SURGICAL PROCEDURES AND INJURY MECHANISMS, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO IDENTIFYING THE BEST NEUROSURGICAL PRACTICES FOR THE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF HC.

Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an alternative to shunting but has limited efficacy in infants. Adding choroid plexus cauterization (CPC) to ETV seems to be a viable alternative to shunting infants. Despite conflicting outcomes, ETV-CPC is currently being offered routinely and globally, and with limited understanding of the risks or benefits of this procedure on brain development. The lack of knowledge about both the surgical and physiological consequences of ETV-CPC constitutes a significant barrier to broad acceptance of this procedure. For example, the impact of ablating the choroid plexus, a major homeostatic organ which regulates neurogenesis and neurodevelopment, has yet to be determined. Experimental studies are needed to determine the role of ETV and ETV-CPC in clinical practice, but the lack of appropriate, validated large animal models in which to test these techniques on brain physiology and, critically, on brain development, has never been studied. Our hypothesis-driven proposal builds on our foundational work that developed a large, clinically-relevant animal model of HC in juvenile domestic pigs and demonstrated feasibility of ETV+CPC, and VPS, thus continuing the goals of NIH PA-180-623, “Tools to Enhance the Study of Prenatal and Pediatric Hydrocephalus”. Three Specific Aims will test our Central Hypothesis that, compared with VPS, ETV+CPC impairs brain development through disruption of VZ/SVZ and PVWM precursor biology and CSF homeostasis with pro-inflammatory signaling: Aim 1 - compare the cytological effects of VPS and ETV+CPC on VZ/SVZ and PVWM; Aim 2 - determine the effect of VPS and ETV+CPC on choroid plexus and CSF profile; Aim 3 - compare neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes in HC animals treated with VPS and ETV+CPC. Supporting these aims are published and preliminary data showing cytopathology in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and periventricular white matter (PVWM) following treatment with VPS and ETV+CPC, ventricular zone (VZ) disruption, SVZ/PVWM cell death, glial activation, and heterotopia, PVWM glial activation and reduced oligodendrocyte progenitors, flow cytometry and single cell RNA sequencing differences in microglia and precursor lineages, CSF cellular and protein alterations, and reduced cognitive assessments. Analyses will be performed at 30- and 90-days post-treatment. Pigs were chosen for studies for their close homology to human neuroanatomy and physiology and the ability to use standard clinical neurosurgical techniques. Successful completion of the proposed studies will fill a critical void in HC research through rigorous testing of emerging surgical procedures and injury mechanisms, which is essential to identifying best neurosurgical practices for the clinical management of HC.",93.853: EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES AND NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS,sub-grant,CD974CCA-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,8,WU-24-0513,327057.00,2024-04-18,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980568.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"SCOPE OF WORK

OVERVIEW OF PROJECT:
HYDROCEPHALUS (HC) IS A COMMON AND DEBILITATING NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION AFFECTING UP TO 1 IN 500 INDIVIDUALS. VENTRICULOPERITONEAL SHUNTING (VPS) HAS BEEN THE STANDARD TREATMENT FOR >60 YEARS BUT SHUNTS REMAIN HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC, WITH AN UNACCEPTABLY HIGH MALFUNCTION RATE, AND OFTEN LEAD TO A LIFETIME OF COMPLEX NEUROSURGICAL CARE. ENDOSCOPIC THIRD VENTRICULOSTOMY WITH CHOROID PLEXUS CAUTERIZATION (ETV+CPC) IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SHUNTING BUT HAS LIMITED EFFICACY IN INFANTS. THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT BOTH THE SURGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF ETV-CPC CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO THE BROAD ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PROCEDURE. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF ETV AND ETV+CPC IN CLINICAL PRACTICE, BUT THE LACK OF APPROPRIATE VALIDATED LARGE ANIMAL MODELS IN WHICH TO TEST THESE TECHNIQUES ON BRAIN PHYSIOLOGY AND, CRITICALLY, ON BRAIN DEVELOPMENT, HAS NEVER BEEN STUDIED.
OUR HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN PROPOSAL BUILDS ON OUR FOUNDATIONAL WORK THAT DEVELOPED A LARGE, CLINICALLY-RELEVANT ANIMAL MODEL OF HC IN JUVENILE DOMESTIC PIGS AND DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF ETV+CPC, AND VPS. THREE SPECIFIC AIMS WILL TEST OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS THAT, COMPARED WITH VPS, ETV+CPC IMPAIRS BRAIN DEVELOPMENT THROUGH DISRUPTION OF VENTRICULAR ZONE (VZ) AND PERIVENTRICULAR WHITE MATTER (PVWM) PRECURSOR BIOLOGY AND CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) HOMEOSTASIS WITH PRO-INFLAMMATORY SIGNALING: AIM 1 - COMPARE THE CYTOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF VPS AND ETV+CPC ON VZ AND PVWM; AIM 2 - DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF VPS AND ETV+CPC ON CHOROID PLEXUS AND CSF PROFILE; AIM 3 - COMPARE NEUROBEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE OUTCOMES IN HC ANIMALS TREATED WITH VPS AND ETV+CPC. SUPPORTING THESE AIMS ARE PUBLISHED AND PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWING CYTOPATHOLOGY IN THE VZ AND PVWM FOLLOWING TREATMENT WITH VPS AND ETV+CPC, VZ/PVWM CELL DEATH, GLIAL ACTIVATION, AND HETEROTOPIA, PVWM GLIAL ACTIVATION AND REDUCED OLIGODENDROCYTE PROGENITORS, FLOW CYTOMETRY AND SINGLE-CELL RNA SEQUENCING DIFFERENCES IN MICROGLIA AND PRECURSOR LINEAGES, CSF CELLULAR AND PROTEIN ALTERATIONS, AND REDUCED COGNITIVE ASSESSMENTS. ANALYSES WILL BE PERFORMED AT 30- AND 90-DAYS POST-TREATMENT. PIGS WERE CHOSEN FOR THESE EXPERIMENTS BECAUSE OF THEIR CLOSE HOMOLOGY TO HUMAN NEUROANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY AND THE ABILITY TO USE STANDARD CLINICAL NEUROSURGICAL TECHNIQUES. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL FILL A CRITICAL VOID IN HC RESEARCH THROUGH RIGOROUS TESTING OF EMERGING SURGICAL PROCEDURES AND INJURY MECHANISMS, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO IDENTIFYING THE BEST NEUROSURGICAL PRACTICES FOR THE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF HC.

Such data firmly highlights the importance of continued efforts to find new and effective ways to detect and treat cancer, with the ultimate goal of reducing the number of diagnoses and fatalities. Epitranscriptomics has lately enlarged insights into the field of cancer biology. RNA modifications occur in coding and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRs). miRs are small single-stranded ncRNAs, which play a crucial role as negative regulators of gene expression, typically via partial base-pairing complementarity with their target transcripts. Post- transcriptional modification phenomena associated with miRs, such as imprecise cleavage of the miRNA sequence and Adenosine-to-Inosine RNA Editing events, can alter the miR canonical sequence and function. Recently, modified miRs (miR isoforms) have been proposed as potential innovative biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and surveillance. However, concurrent profiling of modified miRs has yet to be investigated in cancer properly. Additionally, no online resource offers easy and comprehensive consultation to study miR isoforms in cancer. Solutions to these gaps would positively impact discovering novel potential cancer biomarkers and uncovering cancer-related mechanisms associated with a broader miRNAome. Recently, we concurrently profiled canonical and modified (e.g., shifted or DNA/RNA edited) miRs in >13K adult and pediatric cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) repositories (38 cohorts) (Distefano et al. 2022, Cancer Research). We accurately identified >8K expressed miR isoforms (>5-fold the canonical miRs). By merging canonical and modified miRs, we boosted the quality of clustering results by improving the patients’ clinicopathologic stratification. Additionally, the broader miRNAome profiling uncovered a larger number of significant prognostic signatures. We also implemented an ad-hoc miR isoform-target prediction method and validated unique targeting for a shifted miR isoform. Therefore, our proposal intends to outline (1) the function and (2) the post- transcriptional regulation of the broader miRNAome in a cancer-context manner by in-silico analyses and experimental validations. Moreover, to make the extensive amount of generated data available to the scientific community, we propose (3) building isomiRGate, a freely accessible online gateway. isomiRGate platform will serve as a tool to I) elucidate the role of miR isoforms as potential cancer biomarkers and II) deduce the function and regulation of the broader miRNAome in cancer. We aim to create a platform, isomiRGate, adaptable to new analysis methods, holding the potential to lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for treating this deadly disease, with anticipated future clinical applications.",93.396: CANCER BIOLOGY RESEARCH,sub-grant,CE58BCAC-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,8,GR136013,42239.00,2024-08-12,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,"OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY OFFICE OF SPONSORED PROGRAMS, THE",WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980568.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"MARIO ACUNZO, PH.D.

Patients with AA are susceptible to potentially fatal opportunistic infections, clonal hematopoiesis/leukemogenesis, and chronic transfusion burden.  The workup of a patient with suspected AA takes several weeks during which time the patient receives only supportive care. Immune suppression therapy (IST) and bone marrow transplant (BMT) are the two therapies available for patients once a diagnosis is definitive. For patients with an available matched related donor (MRD), BMT is the standard of care (SOC). Patients lacking a MRD traditionally received IST although many institutions are now prioritizing alternative donor transplant. IST has a 50% response rate over time with the other half of patients requiring additional therapy. BMT has a higher disease-free survival rate but increased potential toxicities including graft versus host disease, infertility and graft rejection. The decision of which therapy to pursue is often the most anxiety-provoking time for families with children that have newly diagnosed AA.  This Phase 2a/2b Trial Emapalumab: A Window of Opportunity in Pediatric Aplastic Anemia leverages data showing that the Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) pathway is associated with the pathogenesis of AA. Pediatric patients with newly diagnosed AA will receive a prophase of an IFNγ neutralizing monoclonal antibody called emapalumab. This prophase will not add time to curative therapy and will occur during the workup period between presentation and start of definitive therapy. At the conclusion of the prophase, patients that have a hematologic response will be consolidated with IST while those that do not will receive institutional SOC. In this way we create an algorithm to try and identify patients that are most likely to have a favorable response to IST. This data-driven identification of which patient should receive IST will help alleviate parental anxiety in making these decisions without sufficient information.  Aim 2 of this project seeks to extend our previous findings that distinct patterns of pediatric clonal hematopoiesis are associated with poor outcomes after IST. Conversely, lack of these markers aligned with favorable IST responses. We will prospectively validate these findings and assess if these specific clonal changes can be used as predictive biomarkers for response to IST. We will also examine if an early upfront prophase with emapalumab can prevent and/or minimize emergence of clonal hematopoiesis by preserving larger reservoirs of hematopoietic stem cells. By combining the data from these two aims, we hope to provide an algorithm to identify pediatric patients with aplastic anemia that are most likely to be cured by IST.",93.103: FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH,sub-grant,C7ADF9C6-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,12,C22772074,30000.00,2024-11-22,2025,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232190002,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"THE INVESTIGATORS WILL IDENTIFY AND ENROLL PATIENTS, OVERSEE STUDY SAMPLE AND DATA COLLECTION, OVERSEE STUDY PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS, DATA MANAGEMENT, DATA ANALYSIS AND MANUSCRIPT PREPARATION.

The overarching hypothesis is “cell-intrinsic and extrinsic glycan-mediated mechanisms regulate maintenance, differentiation, and function of hematopoietic cells.” Project 1 will investigate the roles of the galactosyltransferase ß4GalT1, ß1 integrin, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)/heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in thrombopoiesis at steady-state and following myeloablative stress using novel combined shared “omics” and standard approaches with Project 3.

A functionally defined MK-biased hematopoietic stem cell will be investigated together with Project 2, especially with respect to the heavily a2,6- sialylated cell surface despite the absence of St6gal1 expression necessary to generate this structure. Project 2 will investigate the role of extracellular glycosylation, especially that mediated by extrinsic ST6GAL1 using the combined “omics” approach (Project 1), how extrinsic sialylation in the hematopoietic niche is regulated, identifying the cell surface targets of sialylation; and with Project 3, understanding how the newly discovered GAG cofactor modulates extrinsic ST6GAL1 activity.

Project 3 will investigate the structure–function relationships of GAGs with proteins within the marrow microenvironment, such as growth factors and their receptors, and glycosyltransferases. Their roles in promoting thrombopoiesis and cell fate decisions will be interrogated using a multi-dimensional approach to identifying distinct GAG sequences.

THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, INCLUDING STORMWATER RETENTION, CARBON SEQUESTRATION, AND WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, AMONG OTHERS, CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. 

THE VIRGINIA CZM PROGRAM PROVIDED AN FY1994 GRANT (TASK 28) TO DCR FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A BOARDWALK ON THE PRESERVE WHICH WAS ENJOYED BY THE PUBLIC FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. ORIGINALLY, THE PRESERVE ALLOWED VEHICLES TO GAIN ACCESS A HALF MILE INTO THE PRESERVE TO DECREASE DISTANCE TO THE RIVER FOR CAR-TOP WATERCRAFTS. WITHOUT APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT, THIS DESIGN ALLOWED FOR ILLEGAL ACTIVITY AND THE PRESERVE WAS CLOSED. THE PRESERVE HAS BEEN CLOSED FOR MANY YEARS DUE TO THE LACK OF STAFFING AND INAPPROPRIATE INFRASTRUCTURE. NOW THAT ADDITIONAL STAFF HAVE BEEN HIRED BY THE DIVISION OF NATURAL HERITAGE, THE PRESERVE IS RIPE FOR REOPENING. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO REOPEN NORTH LANDING RIVER NATURAL AREA PRESERVE TO THE PUBLIC FOR EDUCATION AND RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND TO BETTER SECURE NATURAL HERITAGE RESOURCES. 

TO MEET THESE PURPOSES, VARIOUS PUBLIC ACCESS FACILITY PROJECTS WILL BE CONSTRUCTED. THESE INCLUDE CREATION OF A 10-CAR, ADA ACCESSIBLE PARKING LOT VISIBLE FROM BLACKWATER ROAD, INSTALLATION OF A NEW WALK-THROUGH GATE, CONVERSION OF THE EXISTING ACCESS ROAD INTO A SAFE FOOT PATH, AND IMPROVING SAFETY AND EDUCATION BY DEVELOPING AND INSTALLING INTERPRETIVE SIGNS. THE ROAD ENTERING THE PRESERVE WILL BE CONVERTED TO A FOOT PATH BY BUILDING UP THE BASE AND HARDENING A SECTION WITH COMPACTED FINES TO ALLOW FOR FUTURE ADA ACCESSIBILITY USE. NEW SIGNAGE AND A KIOSK WILL BE INSTALLED TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PRESERVE, EXPLAIN RULES AND REGULATIONS, AND ASSIST NAVIGATION. 

ALTHOUGH THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF PROTECTED LANDS ALONG THE NORTH LANDING RIVER, ACCESSIBILITY IS LIMITED. IN ORDER FOR THE PUBLIC TO VALUE THE POCOSIN ECOSYSTEM AND THE RIVER ITSELF, MANY INDIVIDUALS NEED TO SEE, HEAR, TOUCH, AND FEEL THE RESOURCES. THIS PROJECT WILL ALLOW JUST THAT.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) are mechanisms thought to drive CICI, but how these are triggered remains elusive.6,13-15 Our preliminary studies implicate CNS alterations of sphingolipid metabolism and increased sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) formation, offering a novel target for therapeutic intervention with S1P1 receptor subtype (S1PR1) antagonists.  In preliminary studies of cisplatin-induced cognitive impairment, S1P increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (key centers of cognition) where S1PR1 was expressed. This was associated with mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) nitration and inactivation and activation of the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. MnSOD tightly regulates peroxynitrite (PN)-mediated nitroxidative stress,16,17 but is also inactivated >80% when nitrated by PN.18-20 This PN-mediated process has been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction in many disease states.17-19,21-23 NLRP3 is critical for interleukin-1ß (IL1ß) and IL18 maturation,24-26 powerful inflammatory cytokines in cognitive impairment.27-31 Systemic administration of the orally bioavailable, CNS penetrant S1PR1 functional antagonist FTY72032 blocked MnSOD nitration/inactivation, NLRP3 activation and attenuated CICI without adversly affecting locomotor activity (preliminary data). These findings are very exciting, since FTY720 (fingolimod) is FDA-approved for multiple sclerosis with good safety profiles.33-36 How chemotherapy triggers S1P/S1PR1 signaling is not known, but preliminary data suggest glial cell toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as a likely link. We hypothesize that chemotherapy engages TLR4 to drive S1P/S1PR1 signaling in the CNS that contributes to CICI through PN-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation (Fig. 1). We will test this hypothesis in naïve and tumor-bearing male and female mice. In Aim 1, we will investigate S1P/S1PR1 signaling in the CNS, temporal and cellular distribution of S1PR1 and test whether S1PR1 antagonists prevent and reverse CICI without interfering with antitumor effects. In Aim 2, we will use pharmacological and genetic approaches to define the role of TLR4 in sphingolipid metabolism and S1P formation during CICI and test the impact of S1PR1 inhibition on mitochondrial dysfunction and NLRP3-driven neuroinflammation. S1PR1 antagonists are not expected to interfere with chemotherapy efficacy; we and others have shown that these drugs block tumor cell growth, inflammation and metastasis.37-43 Our studies are anticipated to provide paradigm-shifting insights that establish S1PR1 in CICI and expedite translational investigation of medicines that are already FDA approved (fingolimod/ozanimod) as adjunct to chemotherapy.",93.395: CANCER TREATMENT RESEARCH,sub-grant,C51B4AF6-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,2,A01750-15580,43007.00,2024-01-17,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980568.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"DR SARAH SPIEGEL (2% EFFORT, 0.24 CALENDAR MONTHS) AT VCU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF SPHINGOLIPID AND DRUG METABOLITES VIA MASS SPECTROSCOPY.

Conventional vaccines based on pathogens, DNA, proteins, or peptides are associated with poor pharmacokinetics, limited biostability, preexisting anti-viral-vector immunity, weak immunogenicity, or safety concerns over genomic integration or virulent reversion. The emerging mRNA vaccines hold the potential to overcome the above issues with pharmacokinetics and safety using mRNA and advanced drug delivery systems. However, despite efficient delivery, current mRNA vaccines rely on long mRNA that is still associated with 1) limited biostability, though extensively modified, and the resulting limited shelf-life even using cold chains and poor antigen translation efficiency, and 2) complicated enzymatic production. To address these limitations, we propose developing antigen-encoding small circular mRNA (circRNA), which are highly biostable and efficiently delivered by existing nanocarriers, as a novel platform of mRNA vaccines. Small circRNA is comprised of minimal RNA elements to translate peptide antigens. Our preliminary data showed several notable features of small circRNA vaccines: 1) in contrast to long mRNA, small circRNA leverages automated RNA synthesizers for fast, efficient, and precise chemical synthesis and versatile functional modifications; 2) even without any biostabilizing modifications, terminus-free circRNA prevents exonuclease degradation and prolongs its in vivo half-life and shelf-life under freezing, fridge, and ambient temperatures; as a result, circRNA showed efficient antigen translation and immunomodulation; 3) small circRNA vaccines leverage current drug delivery systems for efficient delivery to desired tissues and cells, and the small circRNA sizes can increase its loading capacity in nanocarriers, relative to bulky mRNA; 4) circRNA vaccine is self- adjuvanted due to intrinsic immunostimulation; 5) in cells, circRNA produces long genuine peptide antigens that elicit potent immunity; and 6) the modularity of circRNA vaccine allows its easy adaption for wide application. As a result, low-dose circRNA nanoparticles elicited potent immune responses in both young adult mice and aged mice, protected mice from target cell challenge, and mediated robust tumor immunotherapy. In this application, Aim 1 will optimize the antigen translation and presentation of biostable small circRNA vaccines by circRNA engineering; Aim 2 will study nanoparticle delivery of circRNA into immune tissues and cells, and the stability, integrity, and antigen translation kinetics of circRNA vaccines upon delivery to target cells; Aim 3 will decipher the immunomodulation mechanism by nanoparticle-delivered small circRNA vaccines; and Aim 4 will use human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancer as a test bed to assess the prophylaxis and therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticulate small circRNA vaccine in syngeneic and transgenic mouse tumor models. The PI (Early Stage Investigator) has assembled a team with complementary expertise to conduct this study. If successful, this study will lay the foundation to develop circRNA as a novel platform of mRNA vaccines for wide application in the prophylaxis and treatment of diseases, such as cancer and infectious diseases.

Dystrophin associated cardiomyopathy (defined here as CM) is the leading cause of death in DMD/BMD, and an under-studied concern in DMD and BMD mutation carriers (MDC). CM progression is variable and poorly described in the current era. There are no blood or imaging biomarkers that can predict the pace of progression or the risk of early mortality. More importantly, there are no established cardiac outcome measures. Novel, targeted therapeutics are necessary to treat CM, but these significant knowledge gaps make clinical trials challenging. A better understanding of DMD/BMD/MDC cardiovascular disease progression and the identification of surrogate outcome measures are critical for the field to advance. To address these obstacles, we propose to leverage the Duchenne muscular dystrophy cardiac care consortium (DMDCCC). Created with grants from the NHLBI and the FDA, this consortium consists of eight high-volume sites with similar DMD/BMD/MDC cardiovascular treatment and diagnostic protocols, including surveillance CMR imaging every 1-2 years. This proposal will create a comprehensive prospective registry of DMD/BMD/MDC patients with meticulously collected clinical data and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images; we anticipate enrollment of 950 patients with over 4000 CMR studies. This cohort will be used to better define the progression of CM and to determine associations with mortality. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that integrated statistical modeling based on advanced imaging can improve prediction of CM progression and mortality. Aim 1 will create a comprehensive cohort of DMD/BMD/MDC patients and model the progression of CM. Aim 2 will determine cardiovascular measures that are associated with CM mortality or rapid progression using novel, data-driven, personalized machine learning models. Aim 3 will create a portal for DMD/BMD/MDC centers to determine patient risk. This multi-PI proposal leverages expertise in clinical care, cardiac imaging, biomedical engineering, complex image analysis, and neural networks. To our knowledge, this study will create the largest cohort of DMD/BMD/MDC patients with CMR images, allowing for a better understanding of CM progression and identifying biomarkers that associate with poor outcomes. The resulting risk portal will provide clinicians all over the world with a method to assess their patient’s risk in real time, allowing intensification of therapy for those deemed high risk. By building on prior productive collaborations, particularly that of the DMDCCC, this proposal will expand our understanding of CM, improving clinical care and future cardiac-specific therapeutic trials.",93.837: CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES RESEARCH,sub-grant,CB326A00-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,10,121021,17425.00,2024-09-20,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849040,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,MODELING MORTALITY IN DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY CARDIOMYOPATHY: IDENTIFICATION OF SURROGATE OUTCOME MEASURES FOR DMD DRUG TRIALS,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R01HL167969_075/,2024-10-25 00:00:00+00

As persistent pain experience robustly predicts poorer quality of life overall, racial pain care disparities represent a central factor fueling larger social inequalities. While previous work has identified a host of patient and provider factors that contribute to racial disparities in healthcare in general and thus also likely contributing to disparities in pain care, there has been limited clinically-meaningful progress in eliminating these disparities. Thus, there is an urgent need to address this decades-old inequity by taking an innovative approach. We argue that this lack of progress is due to the fact that prior research has investigated the influence of patient and provider factors in isolation, rather than examining their interaction. Successful pain care requires constructive patient-provider communication, and constructive communication is both dyadic and dynamic. This proposed research will establish the dyadic and dynamic processes underlying patient-provider communication as the key mechanism through which patient and provider factors contribute to racial disparities in both patient- centered and clinical pain outcomes. One well-accepted operationalization of such dyadic processes is behavioral coordination (i.e., spatial/temporal matching in the rhythms or patterns of behaviors between individuals engaged in an interaction, such as synchrony, leader-and-follower dynamics, and turn-taking). We hypothesize that the pain of Black patients continues to be undertreated because Black (vs. White) patients are more likely to participate in racially discordant medical interactions (i.e., seeing other-race providers) and as a result, are more likely to experience disruptions in behavioral coordination. These hypotheses will be tested within the context of preoperative consultations because racial disparities in surgical pain outcomes are well- documented across procedures, and further, the quality of preoperative consultations is linked to post-surgical pain management. We will use a convergent mixed methods research design to assess behavioral coordination quantitatively (e.g., levels, duration, patterns) and qualitatively (e.g., valence, discussion themes). This work will: Aim 1) compare the levels, duration, patterns, and context of behavioral coordination in preoperative consultations (both overall and during pain discussion specifically) between Black and White patients; Aim 2) elucidate links between patient/provider factors and coordination in preoperative consultations; and Aim 3) identify specific aspects of behavioral coordination in preoperative consultations that contribute to racial disparities in post-surgical patient-centered outcomes (e.g., pain management self-efficacy, quality of life) and clinical outcomes (e.g., pain level, prescriptions). Since this research focuses on pain management self-efficacy and quality of life as primary outcomes, findings will be generalizable beyond surgical pain. The proposed work will lay the foundation for developing interventions that target modifiable factors (the dyadic processes underlying patient-provider communication) that can be addressed by leveraging existing infrastructure (medical training).",93.361: NURSING RESEARCH,sub-grant,CCF17836-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,11,GR102971.SUB00000948,442109.00,2024-11-08,2025,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980568.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"DR.

Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, are critical mediators of neuroinflammation that can have either neurotoxic or neurotrophic effects. Progress has been made investigating TBI-induced neuroimmune responses in rodents and therapies showing great promise have moved to clinical trials but failed to translate into beneficial interventions for humans suffering TBI. However, therapies targeting processes that occur in higher order mammals, with immune responses, cytoarchitecture, and metabolic rates similar to humans, such as pigs, would be more likely to translate to the clinic successfully. The neuroinflammatory progression following brain injury in pigs, however, is not well- understood. Our preliminary data demonstrated that microglial processes converge onto injured axonal swellings (microglial process convergence; MPC) in the thalamus of micro pigs, that is not recapitulated in rats, following diffuse TBI but does appear to occur in humans. Studies in mice indicate that this microglial process convergence (MPC) requires functional P2Y12R, however, the mechanisms behind MPC in higher order mammals is currently unknown. Both our preliminary data and previous studies indicate that MPC may be an ameliorative process, promoting axonal outgrowth acutely post-injury. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the roles of microglial changes on pathological progression in a pig model of diffuse TBI. Studies indicate that males have greater pro-inflammatory responses and less axonal outgrowth compared to females. However, there are no known studies evaluating sex as a biological variable in MPC. Accordingly, the current study will address the following specific aims 1) to evaluate the effects of inflammatory and P2Y12R modulation on MPC, neuronal survival and axonal outgrowth/retraction following injury and 2) to assess the prevalence of MPC in human brain tissue following diffuse TBI and other CNS injuries/diseases. To address these aims we will complete quantitative 3D assessments of multiplexed immunohistological samples for microglial-axonal interactions in vitro and in pigs to determine the degree of MPC in relation to axonal outgrowth/retraction changes, P2Y12R expression, and sex-related variability. As the prevalence of MPC following brain injury in the human population is currently unknown, we will also probe for the degree of MPC onto injured axonal swellings, neuronal survival, axonal outgrowth/retraction, and spatially resolved RNA profiles in a unique cohort of postmortem brain tissue. This study is significant because understanding microglial-neuronal interactions and repair mechanisms in higher order species and humans of both sexes will translate into therapeutics strategies for the treatment of TBI.",93.853: EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES AND NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS,sub-grant,CD94EFAC-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,10,FP00018236_SA004,70000.00,2024-10-23,2025,CLC6REB58U73,785883331,RICHMOND INSTITUTE FOR VETERANS RESEARCH,,,,,USA,United States,1201 BROAD ROCK BLVD,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232490001,VA-03,VA-04,,NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232490001,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,MICROGLIAL PROCESS CONVERGENCE FOLLOWING BRAIN INJURY,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R01NS128104_075/,2024-10-31 00:00:00+00

In 2021, 17,002 violent crimes, involving 19,657 victims and including 544 murders, were reported across Virginia. (Note: Unless otherwise indicated, all crime data and figures come from the Virginia State Police’s  Uniform Crime Report for 2021.)  Firearms represented 44.9% of all known weapons used in aggravated assaults in Virginia.  In addition, 15,353 major crimes were reported for 2021 in Norfolk, Newport News, Alexandria, and Richmond. (Note: because EDVA covers many more jurisdictions beyond these four cities proper, this figure is a representative sample, not an inclusive number.)  Of those major crimes, 3582 were violent, consisting of one or more of the following offenses: murder, robbery, rape and other forcible sex offenses, and aggravated assaults.  There were also 31,784 property crimes for these same locations categorized as one or more of the following:  burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and arson.

The primary goal of the PSN Project for the EDVA is to reduce gun and gang violence through deterrence efforts aimed at potential offenders, the implementation of evidence-based programs and proven enforcement strategies to prevent and reduce gun and gang crimes, and the prosecution of significant firearm, controlled substance, and violent crime offenses.  The PSN program will harness the resources of federal, state, and local law enforcement officials throughout EDVA.  The PSN team will incorporate the five design features of PSN to reduce gun and gang violence throughout EDVA and the four PSN target enforcement areas.  The PSN program will require intelligence-led approaches to identify the most violent offenders and neighborhoods in each division, and then deploy combined resources to prevent, interdict, and suppress violent criminal acts by targeted offenders in those areas.",16.609: PROJECT SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS,sub-grant,D36EC5EC-FCCC-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,8,514213,55250.00,2024-05-01,2024,QKJ9G7K275X3,031567833,REAL LIFE,,QKJ9G7K275X3,031567833,REAL LIFE,USA,United States,1111 N 25TH ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232235238,VA-04,VA-04,,"NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,FOUNDATION",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232617372,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"THIS PROJECT FUNDS A NEW VIOLENCE PREVENTION INITIATIVE (VPI) COORDINATOR POSITION.

LOUIS (CITY),29,MO,Missouri,63130,MO-01,MO-01,USA,UNITED STATES,"The role of delta opioid receptors in trigeminovascular pain - Chronic use of commonly used migraine therapies can lead to medication overuse headache (MOH). This is a paradoxical increase in severity of migraine-associated symptoms and headaches which are refractory to other treatments. Currently, the first-line treatment for MOH is drug cessation. However, during this abstinence period, patients continue to suffer from severe migraine, and a majority of MOH patients return to these medications within the first year. Targeted therapies specifically for MOH would result in better headache management and increased patient quality of life. One of the accomplishments of the previous funding cycle of this grant was to test d opioid receptor (dOR) agonists in multiple headache models, including models of MOH. We found that dOR activation completely reversed cephalic allodynia induced by chronic medication treatment, revealing dOR agonists as a novel therapeutic strategy for MOH. In the previous funding cycle, we also performed a large scale unbiased peptidomic screen to identify overlapping mechanisms between chronic migraine and MOH. We identified pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) binding through PAC1 receptor as a potential link between these two disorders; and that the PACAPergic system may be distinctly involved in pain facilitation by chronic medication exposure. Upon further analysis we also found that there is high co-expression between dOR and PACAP or PAC1 in pain-processing regions, including in the periaqueductal grey (PAG) and trigeminal complex. The overall goal of this renewal is to build upon these exciting findings and determine if dOR agonists relieve migraine and MOH through inhibition of the PACAPergic system. In Aim 1, we will test G protein biased dOR agonists in novel translationally significant models of cephalic MOH and determine if they cause tolerance in this model. These studies will strengthen the evidence for drug development of dOR for MOH. In Aim 2 we will map the co-expression of dOR with PACAP and PAC1 and use biochemical and electrophysiological assays to investigate how dOR modulates PACAPergic signaling. Finally, in Aim 3 we will generate conditional knockouts of dOR in PACAP and PAC1 expressing cells, which will reveal if the behavioral effects of dOR agonists are regulated through PACAPergic signaling. The experiments proposed in this application are highly innovative and use a multidisciplinary approach. They will provide important insight on the effectiveness of dOR agonist as a therapeutic target for MOH and headache disorders more broadly and will determine if dOR agonists work through inhibition of the PACAPergic system. Further, the modulation of the PACAPergic system by dOR may be fundamental to other dOR behavioral effects, including emotional modulation and peripheral analgesia.",93.853: EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES AND NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS,sub-grant,CD985728-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,5,WU-23-0629-MOD-1,7668.00,2024-04-05,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980568.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"SCOPE OF WORK

Motor function, particularly of the upper extremity (UE), is critical for regaining independence after stroke. UE function largely depends on integrity of motor cortex and its descending fibers, collectively termed the corticomotor system (CMS). Validated, clinically relevant biomarkers that identify biologically distinct patient subgroups are critically needed, particularly for the often affected and functionally important CMS. Their absence is a major obstacle to developing and personalizing new recovery therapies, especially in the early days post- stroke. Presence or absence of motor evoked potential (MEP) responses to TMS and extent of MRI-measured acute lesion load involving corticospinal tract (CST) are ready for formal validation. Also, the Predict Recovery Potential (PREP)-2 prediction tool, which sequentially combines acute clinical information and MEP status, is primed for multi-site validation. Our current objective, well-aligned with StrokeNet’s, is to validate the most biologically relevant and primed biomarkers of 90-day UE motor outcomes after ischemic stroke in the first large- scale, prospective, acute dataset of clinical, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and MRI measures. The central hypothesis is that patients have different UE outcomes depending on CMS function measured with TMS, and on CST injury measured with MRI. The proposed study, “Validation of Early Prognostic Data for Recovery Outcomes after Stroke for Future, Higher Yield Trials” (VERIFY), will collect data from 657 patients at 30 US sites to address the following specific aims. Aim 1: To externally validate the relationships that TMS and MRI biomarkers of CMS integrity acquired < 7 days after stroke have with UE motor impairment outcome at 90 days after ischemic stroke. Aim 2: To externally validate the PREP2 prediction tool used < 7 days after stroke to predict 90-day UE functional outcome for individual patients with ischemic stroke. Our multi-dimensional approach to UE motor outcomes is an innovative advance on previous biomarker studies, which were typically limited to predicting outcomes in one or two domains. We will comprehensively measure UE outcomes 90 days post-stroke in three domains of motor performance —impairment, function, and use — identified by the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Our cross-disciplinary team has established expertise in multicenter acute trials, neurophysiology, neuroimaging, and stroke recovery and rehabilitation. The results are expected to have a positive impact because biomarkers used in the acute stroke period to identify patient subgroups with distinct day-90 outcomes can aid stroke recovery trials and inform rehabilitation decision-making.",93.853: EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES AND NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS,sub-grant,238997DC-FCD2-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2025,3,013381- 143222,39250.00,2025-02-23,2025,CLC6REB58U73,785883331,RICHMOND INSTITUTE FOR VETERANS RESEARCH,,,,,USA,United States,1201 BROAD ROCK BLVD,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232490001,VA-03,VA-04,,NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232494915,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,CLINICAL TRIAL AGREEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_U01NS120910_075/,2025-03-06 00:00:00+00

Local governments and community organizations are increasing focusing on community violence intervention and prevention (CVI) approaches. CVI work brings together a wide range of community partners, from government agencies to nonprofits and residents, to identify their roles in violence reduction, coordinate among each other and form a comprehensive and holistic approach that comprises elements of both intervention and prevention. CVI programs are complex undertakings, relying on authentic community input, led by staff with very specific skills and backgrounds, depending on comprehensive and complementary partnerships, and demanding high-quality, engaged, and flexible TTA. LISC will work with BJA to support communities through the FY2022 Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative (CVIPI). As a Category 5 Capacity Building intermediary, LISC will select local grantees and provide grant funding and TTA to help them: partner effectively, engage community members and stakeholders, use data to inform strategy selection, and implement sustainable strategies integrated into comprehensive community revitalization efforts. 

 

LISC Safety & Justice will work with each grantee site to assess their strengths and needs, tailor TTA to meet the needs, measure progress, and plan for sustainability. LISC will create and maintain a library of resources to help grantees as well as the larger community safety field understand topics such as how to form effective partnerships, how to select appropriate CVI strategies, and how to measure success. 

 

Using expertise gained from serving as National TTA Provider to three Department of Justice programs (focusing on place-based community violence, rural violent crime, and school violence), LISC will deploy its Safety & Justice staff and contract with several subject matter experts (SMEs) with which LISC has existing relationships to serve the CVIPI sites. These SMEs include experts in street outreach, gun violence, and other topics.

 

As a result of LISC’s TTA, grantees will increase their ability form effective multisector collaborations to address community violence challenges, center equity, inclusion and community leadership, identify appropriate data- and research-informed solutions, and sustainably integrate CVI strategies into broader community revitalization plans.",16.045: COMMUNITY-BASED VIOLENCE INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION INITIATIVE,sub-grant,D37CCCFA-FCCC-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2023,12,48450-0003,150000.00,2023-10-02,2024,TTA9SHN43C57,,VA LEAGUE FOR SAFER STREETS INC.,LOCAL INITIATIVES SUPPORT CORP,,,,USA,United States,2213 ALTHEA ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232224635,VA-04,VA-04,,"MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESS,NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,FOUNDATION,BLACK AMERICAN OWNED",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,23222.0,VA-04,VA-04,USA,United States,"THE PURPOSE OF THIS GRANT IS:

When individuals become dislocated workers because of job loss, mass layoffs, global trade dynamics or transitions in economic sectors, the WIOA DW program provides services to assist them in reentering the workforce.Activities to be performed: WIOA specifies that most DW services will be provided through the American Job Center network, also known as one-stop career centers. Under the DW program, eligible individuals will receive career services, which are classified into two categories: basic and individualized services. While some job seekers may only need self-service or other basic career services such as labor exchange services, others may need more comprehensive services, such as individualized services, which include career planning, and developing an individual employment plan outlining needs and goals of the job seeker. Participants will also receive training services linked to job opportunities in their communities.  To promote customer choice and involvement in career decisions, participants use an Individual Training Account to select an appropriate training program from an eligible training provider list. WIOA also authorizes the provision of supportive services (e.g. transportation and childcare assistance) to enable an individual to participate in the program.Expected Outcomes: The WIOA Dislocated Worker program outcomes are to ensure that individuals can access and receive the employment and training services they are eligible for, so that they may become employed or advance in employment. Grantees report performance measures of these outcomes, including the percentage of people employed in the second and fourth quarter after finishing.Intended beneficiaries: Individuals who lose their jobs because of layoffs, global trade dynamics, or other economic transitions, such individuals who have received a notice of termination or layoff from employment, including a separation notice from active military services.

When individuals become dislocated workers because of job loss, mass layoffs, global trade dynamics or transitions in economic sectors, the WIOA DW program provides services to assist them in reentering the workforce.Activities to be performed: WIOA specifies that most DW services will be provided through the American Job Center network, also known as one-stop career centers. Under the DW program, eligible individuals will receive career services, which are classified into two categories: basic and individualized services. While some job seekers may only need self-service or other basic career services such as labor exchange services, others may need more comprehensive services, such as individualized services, which include career planning, and developing an individual employment plan outlining needs and goals of the job seeker. Participants will also receive training services linked to job opportunities in their communities.  To promote customer choice and involvement in career decisions, participants use an Individual Training Account to select an appropriate training program from an eligible training provider list. WIOA also authorizes the provision of supportive services (e.g. transportation and childcare assistance) to enable an individual to participate in the program.Expected Outcomes: The WIOA Dislocated Worker program outcomes are to ensure that individuals can access and receive the employment and training services they are eligible for, so that they may become employed or advance in employment. Grantees report performance measures of these outcomes, including the percentage of people employed in the second and fourth quarter after finishing.Intended beneficiaries: Individuals who lose their jobs because of layoffs, global trade dynamics, or other economic transitions, such individuals who have received a notice of termination or layoff from employment, including a separation notice from active military services.

Further, the frequent co-occurrence of SUD and PTSD has clinical implications, including greater symptom severity, poorer treatment prognosis, and poor physical health, compared to either disorder alone. Thus, there is a great need to understand their etiologic underpinnings to best inform prevention and intervention efforts. SUD and PTSD are both moderately heritable, with correlated genetic risk demonstrated by twin studies. Recent advances in statistical genetics have produced multivariate methods well suited for comorbidity applications that expand upon genetic correlations to examine causality (i.e., Mendalian Randomization [MR]), and to boost power for identification of disorder-specific and shared genetic risk (i.e., genomic structural equation modeling [gSEM]). Our work thus far has focused on the genetic relationships of PTSD with alcohol use disorder (AUD), demonstrating a significant genetic correlation between PTSD and AUD (rG=.35), and finding a support for a causal effect of PTSD on AUD. While these findings provide clues for the relationships between PTSD and other common SUD, the genetic relationships between PTSD with other SUDs, especially cannabis, and opioid use disorders remain relatively unexplored. The first aim of this project is to harness the existing large GWAS samples brought together by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) SUD and PTSD workgroups, to characterize the genetic relationship between SUDs and PTSD using state-of-the-science statistical genetic techniques. Initial GWAS in the PTSD and SUD workgroups have largely focused on broad phenotypes that are amendable for harmonization across cohorts. Thus, there is an unfilled need for increased data acquisition and harmonization within the workgroups to allow for more nuanced scientific questions about the PTSD-SUD relationship to be answered. For example, it is unknown if the nature of the PTSD-SUD genetic relationship is influenced by trauma characteristics (i.e., age of onset, type of trauma), differs as a function of substance use versus disorder, and how genomic risk unfolds in comorbid PTSD-SUD cases. The second aim of this project is to interrogate these more nuanced scientific questions by expanding phenotyping within the PGC groups. Importantly, existing research is limited by the under-representation of individuals of African and Latinx ancestry. The third aim of this project is to increase inclusion of diverse participants within the PTSD and SUD PGC workgroups. We will determine whether Aim 1 findings extend to populations of African and Latinx ancestry by integrating three large and diverse existing studies with data on SUD, PTSD, and trauma, and build additional collaborations to increase diversity in the PGC workgroups.

Further, the frequent co-occurrence of SUD and PTSD has clinical implications, including greater symptom severity, poorer treatment prognosis, and poor physical health, compared to either disorder alone. Thus, there is a great need to understand their etiologic underpinnings to best inform prevention and intervention efforts. SUD and PTSD are both moderately heritable, with correlated genetic risk demonstrated by twin studies. Recent advances in statistical genetics have produced multivariate methods well suited for comorbidity applications that expand upon genetic correlations to examine causality (i.e., Mendalian Randomization [MR]), and to boost power for identification of disorder-specific and shared genetic risk (i.e., genomic structural equation modeling [gSEM]). Our work thus far has focused on the genetic relationships of PTSD with alcohol use disorder (AUD), demonstrating a significant genetic correlation between PTSD and AUD (rG=.35), and finding a support for a causal effect of PTSD on AUD. While these findings provide clues for the relationships between PTSD and other common SUD, the genetic relationships between PTSD with other SUDs, especially cannabis, and opioid use disorders remain relatively unexplored. The first aim of this project is to harness the existing large GWAS samples brought together by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) SUD and PTSD workgroups, to characterize the genetic relationship between SUDs and PTSD using state-of-the-science statistical genetic techniques. Initial GWAS in the PTSD and SUD workgroups have largely focused on broad phenotypes that are amendable for harmonization across cohorts. Thus, there is an unfilled need for increased data acquisition and harmonization within the workgroups to allow for more nuanced scientific questions about the PTSD-SUD relationship to be answered. For example, it is unknown if the nature of the PTSD-SUD genetic relationship is influenced by trauma characteristics (i.e., age of onset, type of trauma), differs as a function of substance use versus disorder, and how genomic risk unfolds in comorbid PTSD-SUD cases. The second aim of this project is to interrogate these more nuanced scientific questions by expanding phenotyping within the PGC groups. Importantly, existing research is limited by the under-representation of individuals of African and Latinx ancestry. The third aim of this project is to increase inclusion of diverse participants within the PTSD and SUD PGC workgroups. We will determine whether Aim 1 findings extend to populations of African and Latinx ancestry by integrating three large and diverse existing studies with data on SUD, PTSD, and trauma, and build additional collaborations to increase diversity in the PGC workgroups. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the genetic relationships between SUD and PTSD while increasing representation of individuals of diverse ancestry in psychiatric genetics research.",93.242: MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH GRANTS; 93.279: DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION RESEARCH PROGRAMS; 93.279: DRUG USE AND ADDICTION RESEARCH PROGRAMS,sub-grant,C5C96212-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,5,100-1187335-99511,210229.00,2024-02-22,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980126.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK (SUNY) DOWNSTATE HEALTH SCIENCES UNIVERSITY WILL SUBCONTRACT

TIER 1: UNIVERSAL, PRIMARY PREVENTION (ALL) 

ÃƑÂ€ŠÃ‚Â· TIER 1 SYSTEMS, DATA, AND PRACTICES SUPPORT EVERYONE ÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã¢Â‚¬Å“ STUDENTS, EDUCATORS, AND STAFF ÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã¢Â‚¬Å“ ACROSS ALL SCHOOL SETTINGS. THEY ESTABLISH A FOUNDATION FOR POSITIVE AND PROACTIVE SUPPORT. TIER 1 SUPPORT IS ROBUST, DIFFERENTIATED, AND ENABLES MOST (80% OR MORE) STUDENTS TO EXPERIENCE SUCCESS.

To mitigate the spread of COVID-19, some U.S. states enacted policies like stay-at-home orders and business closures. To mitigate adverse economic and health effects, some states enacted policies like eviction moratoria and extended unemployment benefits. These policies may have affected adults’ psychological health and related mortality through social isolation, work-family conflict, interpersonal strain, economic wellbeing, employment disruptions, and more. The overarching objective of this proposal is to rigorously assess how state-level COVID-19 mitigation policies have affected psychological health and related mortality from drug overdose and suicide among working age and older adults. The project is significant and will have a sustained impact because it: 1) identifies how states’ mitigation policies affect psychological health and mortality in both the short and longer- terms, 2) leverages adults’ self-reports of how COVID-19 and mitigation policies affected their lives and psychological health with county-level administrative data on drug overdose and suicide mortality, and 3) empirically develops meaningful composite measures of state mitigation policies to assess their impact on psychological health and mortality. The project is innovative in that it: 1) uses and extends novel survey data from working-age adults on how the pandemic and its mitigation policies affected their lives, 2) uses recently- developed methods for analyzing large contextual datasets containing high-dimensional and correlated data and 3) focuses on the impacts of policies on psychological health and related causes of death, specifically drug- overdoses and suicides, in the short and longer terms. The project will accomplish its objective through three Specific Aims. Aim 1 identifies how U.S. states’ COVID-19 policies are associated with adult psychological health. It uses a new, national survey of U.S. adults aged 18-64 (National Wellbeing Survey) conducted in Feb/Mar 2021 by PI Monnat. Using its self-reported data on how COVID-19 has affected people’s lives, we will assess: a) how states’ COVID-19 policies predict individuals’ psychological health approximately one year after COVID-19 began in the U.S., b) how economic, social, and health care conditions help explain the associations; and c) how the associations vary by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education. Aim 2 identifies how U.S. states’ COVID-19 policies affected fatal drug overdose and suicide rates at the county level. Using mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System, we will assess: a) the immediate and lagged effects of states’ COVID-19 policies on county-level fatal drug overdose and suicide rates among adults aged 18 and older, b) how economic, social, and health care conditions explain these effects, and c) variation by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Aim 3 collects four new annual waves of the NWS, in close collaboration with the Consortium, to identify longer-term consequences of states’ COVID-19 policies and individuals’ adaptations on adult psychological health.",93.279: DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION RESEARCH PROGRAMS; 93.279: DRUG USE AND ADDICTION RESEARCH PROGRAMS; 93.310: TRANS-NIH RESEARCH SUPPORT,sub-grant,213BF1FA-FCD2-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,2,32568-06057-S01,-92147.35,2024-02-20,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980568,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"DR.

The program is authorized under Title 1 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Public Law 93-383, as amended 42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq. The CDBG Program covers four distinct programs, each with their own set of governing regulations: CDBG Entitlement, CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii, CDBG Insular Areas, and State CDBG.

In the CDBG Entitlement Program, HUD awards grants to entitlement community grantees to carry out a wide range of community development activities. Entitlement communities develop their own programs and funding priorities.

In the CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii Program, three counties qualify: Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui. The FY 2004 Appropriations Act required the Governor of Hawaii to decide if the State wished to participate in the State CDBG program by July 31, 2004. The State made the decision not to participate in the program. As a result of this decision HUD's Honolulu Field Office administers the non-entitled grants in Hawaii. Funds are allocated using a formula based on population, poverty, and housing overcrowding, with the poverty factor carrying a double weight.

For the CDBG Insular Areas Program, HUD annually allocates CDBG grants to four designated areas: American Samoa; Guam; Northern Mariana Islands; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The funds are allocated in proportion to the populations of the eligible Territories. The program is administered by HUD's Field Offices in Puerto Rico and Hawaii.  

Under the State CDBG Program, States pass through CDBG grants to units of general local government. Annually, each State develops funding priorities and criteria for selecting projects. Since States are in the best position to know, and to respond to, the needs of local governments, Congress amended the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act) in 1981 to give each State the opportunity to administer CDBG funds for non-entitlement areas. Non-entitlement areas include those units of general local government which do not receive CDBG funds directly from HUD. Generally, non-entitlement areas are cities with populations of less than 50,000 (except cities that are designated principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas), and counties with populations of less than 200,000.

Current CDBG awards and allocations are included in this list of HUD Community Planning and Development (CPD) awards and allocations located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/GRANTEES/ALLOCATIONS-AWARDS/; Activities to be Performed: CDBG funds may be used for activities which include, but are not limited to: Acquisition of real property; Relocation and demolition; Rehabilitation of residential and non-residential structures; Construction of public facilities and improvements, such as water and sewer facilities, streets, neighborhood centers, and the conversion of school buildings for eligible purposes; Public services, within certain limits; Activities relating to energy conservation and renewable energy resources; Provision of assistance to profit-motivated businesses to carry out economic development and job creation/retention activities. Each activity must meet one of the following national objectives for the program: benefit low- and moderate-income persons, prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or address community development needs having a particular urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community for which other funding is not available. Generally, the following types of activities are ineligible: Acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of buildings for the general conduct of government; Political activities; Certain income payments; Construction of new housing (with some exceptions). 

Under the State CDBG Program, States may use $100,000 plus up to a maximum of three percent of its CDBG allocation. Amounts expended on administration in excess of $100,000 must be matched. States may expend up to three percent of their CDBG allocation on technical assistance activities. However, the total a state spends on both administrative and technical assistance expenses may not exceed $100,000 plus three percent of the state's allocation.

CPD has developed profiles that display grantee-reported accomplishments for selected housing, economic development, public improvement, and public service activities. Profiles for grantees will vary, as grantees have flexibility in determining the housing, economic, and community development activities they carry out with CDBG funds. The most recent accomplishments can be viewed within the National Accomplishment Reports located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg/cdbg-accomplishment-reports/; Expected Outcomes: The CDBG program reinforces several important values and principles of community development: program flexibility to empower people and communities to design and implement strategies tailored to their own needs and priorities; an emphasis on consolidated planning that expands and strengthens partnerships among all levels of government and the private sector in enhancing community development; technical assistance activities and set-aside for grantees to build the capacity of these partners. Each CDBG grantee’s expected outcomes are described as goals in their Consolidated Plan.  The most recent Consolidated Plans can be viewed at: https://www.hudexchange.info/grantees/reports/#consolidated-plans-annual-action-plans-and-capers; Intended Beneficiaries: Over a 1, 2, or 3-year period, as selected by the grantee, not less than 70 percent of CDBG funds must be used for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons. HUD does not provide CDBG assistance directly to individuals, businesses, nonprofit or organizations or other non-governmental entities. Individuals who are interested in participating in this program, should contact their local municipal or county officials to find out how the program operates in their community. Participation requirements may differ from one grantee to another. 

With the exception of the State CDBG Program, the local government grantee administers the CDBG program and determines which local projects receive funding. Eligible grantees are as follows: Principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs); Other metropolitan cities with populations of at least 50,000; Qualified urban counties with populations of at least 200,000 (excluding the population of entitled cities); States and insular areas.

The District of Columbia is funded under the CDBG Entitlement Program. The State of Hawaii does not participate, and HUD allocates the state's share of funds to the three Hawaii non-entitled counties. 

The States administer CDBG funds in the State CDBG Program.

The program is authorized under Title 1 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, Public Law 93-383, as amended 42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq. The CDBG Program covers four distinct programs, each with their own set of governing regulations: CDBG Entitlement, CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii, CDBG Insular Areas, and State CDBG.

In the CDBG Entitlement Program, HUD awards grants to entitlement community grantees to carry out a wide range of community development activities. Entitlement communities develop their own programs and funding priorities.

In the CDBG Non-entitled Counties in Hawaii Program, three counties qualify: Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui. The FY 2004 Appropriations Act required the Governor of Hawaii to decide if the State wished to participate in the State CDBG program by July 31, 2004. The State made the decision not to participate in the program. As a result of this decision HUD's Honolulu Field Office administers the non-entitled grants in Hawaii. Funds are allocated using a formula based on population, poverty, and housing overcrowding, with the poverty factor carrying a double weight.

For the CDBG Insular Areas Program, HUD annually allocates CDBG grants to four designated areas: American Samoa; Guam; Northern Mariana Islands; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The funds are allocated in proportion to the populations of the eligible Territories. The program is administered by HUD's Field Offices in Puerto Rico and Hawaii.  

Under the State CDBG Program, States pass through CDBG grants to units of general local government. Annually, each State develops funding priorities and criteria for selecting projects. Since States are in the best position to know, and to respond to, the needs of local governments, Congress amended the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act) in 1981 to give each State the opportunity to administer CDBG funds for non-entitlement areas. Non-entitlement areas include those units of general local government which do not receive CDBG funds directly from HUD. Generally, non-entitlement areas are cities with populations of less than 50,000 (except cities that are designated principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas), and counties with populations of less than 200,000.

Current CDBG awards and allocations are included in this list of HUD Community Planning and Development (CPD) awards and allocations located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/GRANTEES/ALLOCATIONS-AWARDS/; Activities to be Performed: CDBG funds may be used for activities which include, but are not limited to: Acquisition of real property; Relocation and demolition; Rehabilitation of residential and non-residential structures; Construction of public facilities and improvements, such as water and sewer facilities, streets, neighborhood centers, and the conversion of school buildings for eligible purposes; Public services, within certain limits; Activities relating to energy conservation and renewable energy resources; Provision of assistance to profit-motivated businesses to carry out economic development and job creation/retention activities. Each activity must meet one of the following national objectives for the program: benefit low- and moderate-income persons, prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or address community development needs having a particular urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community for which other funding is not available. Generally, the following types of activities are ineligible: Acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of buildings for the general conduct of government; Political activities; Certain income payments; Construction of new housing (with some exceptions). 

Under the State CDBG Program, States may use $100,000 plus up to a maximum of three percent of its CDBG allocation. Amounts expended on administration in excess of $100,000 must be matched. States may expend up to three percent of their CDBG allocation on technical assistance activities. However, the total a state spends on both administrative and technical assistance expenses may not exceed $100,000 plus three percent of the state's allocation.

CPD has developed profiles that display grantee-reported accomplishments for selected housing, economic development, public improvement, and public service activities. Profiles for grantees will vary, as grantees have flexibility in determining the housing, economic, and community development activities they carry out with CDBG funds. The most recent accomplishments can be viewed within the National Accomplishment Reports located at: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg/cdbg-accomplishment-reports/; Expected Outcomes: The CDBG program reinforces several important values and principles of community development: program flexibility to empower people and communities to design and implement strategies tailored to their own needs and priorities; an emphasis on consolidated planning that expands and strengthens partnerships among all levels of government and the private sector in enhancing community development; technical assistance activities and set-aside for grantees to build the capacity of these partners. Each CDBG grantee’s expected outcomes are described as goals in their Consolidated Plan.  The most recent Consolidated Plans can be viewed at: https://www.hudexchange.info/grantees/reports/#consolidated-plans-annual-action-plans-and-capers; Intended Beneficiaries: Over a 1, 2, or 3-year period, as selected by the grantee, not less than 70 percent of CDBG funds must be used for activities that benefit low- and moderate-income persons. HUD does not provide CDBG assistance directly to individuals, businesses, nonprofit or organizations or other non-governmental entities. Individuals who are interested in participating in this program, should contact their local municipal or county officials to find out how the program operates in their community. Participation requirements may differ from one grantee to another. 

With the exception of the State CDBG Program, the local government grantee administers the CDBG program and determines which local projects receive funding. Eligible grantees are as follows: Principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs); Other metropolitan cities with populations of at least 50,000; Qualified urban counties with populations of at least 200,000 (excluding the population of entitled cities); States and insular areas.

The District of Columbia is funded under the CDBG Entitlement Program. The State of Hawaii does not participate, and HUD allocates the state's share of funds to the three Hawaii non-entitled counties. 

The States administer CDBG funds in the State CDBG Program. Since States are in the best position to know, and to respond to, the needs of local governments, Congress amended the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act) in 1981 to give each State the opportunity to administer CDBG funds for non-entitlement areas.; Subrecipient Activities: The subrecipient activities are unknown at the time of award.",14.218: COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS/ENTITLEMENT GRANTS,sub-grant,756AC800-FCC8-11EF-9825-93915A4CF5B0,2024,10,CT-47-23211,444000.00,2024-07-01,2024,R884ZZGNQKT5,801695842,ELDERHOMES CORP,,R884ZZGNQKT5,801695842,,USA,United States,88 CARNATION ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232256811,VA-04,VA-04,,"NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232256811.0,VA-04,VA-04,USA,United States,"THE SUBRECIPIENT PROJECT HOMES CRITICAL HOME REPAIR AKA ""ELDER HOMES"" PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FUNDAMENTAL HOME REPAIRS TO LOW INCOME, ELDERLY OR DISABLED OWNER-OCCUPANTS IN AN EFFORT TO HELP THEM CONTINUE TO SAFELY LIVE IN THEIR HOMES.",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_B-24-MC-51-0016_086/,2024-10-17 00:00:00+00

Proper metabolic transition is essential for establishing normal heart physiology. The long-term goal of this project is to reveal the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate this cardiac metabolic shift using mouse models and ultimately translate our discoveries into clinical applications addressing inborn cardiomyopathies.  Mono-ubiquitination of histone H2A K119 (H2AK119Ub) is a major post-translational modification of histone H2A, occurring in 5-15% of total H2A in mammalian cells. H2AK119Ub in the promoter region inhibits RNA polymerase II elongation and acts as a repressive epigenetic mechanism to regulate key developmental programs from drosophila to mammals. The precise level of H2AK119Ub is dynamically controlled by the balance between ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases. USP16 is a histone H2AK119Ub-specific deubiquitinase that de- represses gene transcription. To test the role of USP16 in hearts, we specifically deleted Usp16 in the myocardium. All mutant mice died within 3 days after birth and displayed severe myocardial wall anomalies. Our subsequent two-hybrid and biochemical analyses revealed that Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1 (NRF1) is a novel USP16 interaction partner. NRF1 is a nuclear transcription factor that activates expression of the vast majority of nuclear genes encoding subunits of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes.  In support of the functional significance of the USP16-NRF1 interaction, our mRNA-Sequencing analysis revealed that the pathway involved in OXPHOS was most significantly downregulated by myocardial deletion of Usp16. We propose our central hypothesis that USP16 interacts with NRF1 to upregulate expression of nuclear OXPHOS genes, supporting the metabolic shift in perinatal hearts. In Aim 1, we will test how deletion of Usp16 affects the metabolic shift in perinatal hearts. In Aim 2, we will test if OXPHOS genes are major direct regulatory targets of USP16 in perinatal hearts using high-throughput approaches. In Aim 3, we will test the role of NRF1 in loading USP16 onto its target sites.  This project will fill a major knowledge gap regarding the basic molecular mechanism underlying the cardiac metabolic shift, which is critical for the proper transition to extra-uterine life. Our research will contribute to the development of novel clinical applications aimed at OXPHOS-associated heart defects.",93.837: CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES RESEARCH,sub-grant,CB323008-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,5,39942-1 ORIG,31320.00,2024-04-18,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,GEORGIA HEALTH SCIENCES,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"IN THIS R01 APPLICATION, DR.

The WIOA DW program aims to help dislocated workers get back to work as quickly as possible and overcome barriers to employment. When individuals become dislocated workers because of job loss, mass layoffs, global trade dynamics or transitions in economic sectors, the Dislocated Worker program provides services to assist them in reentering the workforce. Activities performed--WIOA specifies that most DW services will be provided through the American Job Center network, also known as one-stop career centers. Under the DW program, eligible individuals will receive career services, which are classified into two categories: basic and individualized services. While some job seekers may only need self-service or other basic career services such as labor exchange services, others may need more comprehensive services, such as individualized services, which include career planning, and developing an individual employment plan outlining needs and goals of the job seeker. Participants will also receive training services linked to job opportunities in their communities. To promote customer choice and involvement in career decisions, participants use an Individual Training Account to select an appropriate training program from an eligible training provider list. WIOA also authorizes the provision of supportive services (e.g. transportation and child care assistance) to enable an individual to participate in the program. Deliverables--The WIOA Dislocated Worker program outcomes are to ensure that individuals can access and receive the training services they are eligible for, so that they may overcome barriers to employment and reenter the workforce systems quickly as possible. Intended beneficiary--The WIOA Dislocated Worker program is designed to help workers get back to work as quickly as possible and overcome barriers to employment. When individuals become dislocated workers as a result of job loss, mass layoffs, global trade dynamics, or transitions in economic sectors, the Dislocated Worker program provides services to assist them in re-entering the workforce.

Historic racist housing policies (e.g., federal redlining, restrictive deeds and covenants) influenced the physical, social and economic structure of places resulting in racial and socioeconomic residential segregation in the US. The systemic denial of homeownership opportunities through racist housing policies may be a key upstream source of mid-life health inequities observed across the US today through restrictions wealth and place-based investment over time. Our previous work has shown that Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) redlining from 1935-40 is associated with high minority, low socioeconomic neighborhoods with shorter average life expectancy, higher neighborhood prevalence of chronic diseases, and worse physical and mental health. However, few studies have investigated the mechanisms by which historic redlining, subsequent neighborhood trajectories of investment and disinvestment, and racial residential segregation over time have shaped place-based inequalities in `exposure' to harmful environments (e.g., industrial toxins) and `access' to health promoting resources (e.g., health care services) that impact individual-level morbidity and mortality. The proposed project will address this gap by, first, harmonizing siloed data sources to produce a national database of historical redlining, historic and current environmental hazards, housing investment, gentrification, and longitudinal neighborhood demographics and socioeconomics. Then, we will examine structural racism as it is embedded in neighborhoods with 1) the resulting inequalities in neighborhood `access and exposure' that drive health opportunities (Aim 2), and 2) disparities in morbidity and mortality risk beginning in mid-life in a nationally representative longitudinal study, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (Aim 3). We hypothesize that historically redlined areas will have greater proximity to present-day environmental hazards and reduced access to healthcare and health promoting resources, and that longitudinal neighborhood change associated with redlining will partially mediate these associations. We further hypothesize that HRS participants living in historically redlined areas will have greater risk of morbidity and mortality than HRS participants not living in redlined areas and that this association will vary by present-day intensity of racial residential segregation. This project will create actionable knowledge to address health inequities beginning in mid-life by uncovering how macrostructural factors, including historic, racist government policies result neighborhood and individual health disparities.

Mentoring at Boys & Girls Clubs (MBGC) is a multicomponent mentoring program that will leverage BGCAs nationwide Club affiliate network to connect at-risk youth with caring mentors to provide positive youth development and targeted skill-building programs that address individual youth risk factors. The target population is youth ages 617 experiencing risk factors in low-income communities in all 50 states. This population includes American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth living both on and off reservations, youth involved in the juvenile justice system, and youth from underserved and culturally specific communities. Risk factors include poverty, low-performing schools, and community violence. AI/AN youth experience especially high levels of risk. Youth who experience one or more risk factors are more likely to become involved in delinquency, substance use, and other problem behaviors.

Project goals are to promote positive outcomes and reduce negative outcomes for five target groups: youth at risk; AI/AN youth; military-connected youth; and youth at risk for system involvement or already system involved, including detained youth. Additional youth from underserved populations will be served under the proposed Innovation in Locally Responsive Mentoring initiative. Project objectives include providing each youth with a mentor and engaging them in at least two evidence-based or evidence-informed skill-building programs. Project activities include small group, one-on-one, and peer mentoring, delivered in the youth development environment of a Boys & Girls Club, and a variety of programs building skills in three areas: healthy decision making/risk avoidance, academics, and social-emotional. Mentors and mentees will be matched based on mutual interests and individual mentee needs and risk factors. Mentees and mentors will meet for 12 hours a week for a minimum of 1 year. Program curricula include racial equity elements and adaptations for Native youth. Youth and family partnerships are a core program strategy. Program enhancements include an online mentor training featuring Club best practices; a resource guide featuring antibullying strategies; training webinars focused on integrating mentoring into new program areas and strategies for increasing family partnerships for system-involved youth; and community listening sessions at MBGC Clubs serving marginalized populations. Anticipated youth outcomes include increases in social competence, school attendance, GPA, and positive family relationships; decreases in antisocial behavior and substance abuse; and increased resistance to involvement in delinquency.

As these IoT devices diversify and rapidly evolve in size, shape, and form to integrate seamlessly into households, assessing crime scenes for such devices becomes challenging. Research efforts provide detailed guidelines for investigators but often overlook that IoT data is stored not only on devices and their applications but also on cloud storage and other connected devices through wireless communication. Furthermore, there is a lack of robust and user-friendly tools specifically designed to aid in the survey of crime scenes and facilitate investigations by detecting nearby wireless devices. This Technical Training and Assistance (TTA) program aims to address this gap by providing research-based, scientifically, legally, and operationally sound training and developing a publicly accessible smartphone application. This application will be designed to scan crime scenes by detecting beaconing signals from nearby Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices. An example legal procedure will also be designed to secure this evidence lawfully, establish a chain of custody, introduce relevant expert witnesses and specialized knowledge testimonies, develop persuasive exhibits, and formulate a prosecutorial strategy. In addition, Purdue and NW3C will collaborate closely to create exemplary presentations and compelling demonstration exhibits. This collaboration is crucial in clarifying the digital evidence obtained from IoT technologies and illustrating its pivotal role in investigations, legal proceedings, and trials. These joint efforts align with the LECCs objectives of enhancing awareness, expanding educational opportunities, and bolstering the capabilities of criminal justice professionals. Moreover, face-to-face training sessions, along with live and on-demand webinars, are planned to bridge the existing educational gap for numerous attendees. These sessions will focus on the legal procedures to preserve, acquire, and exhibit digital evidence from IoT devices. This TTA program will include online databases/resources for IoT device capabilities and vulnerabilities, and related training modules executed with all sample presentations and exhibits. All technical assistance resources will be hosted on the secure portal maintained by NW3C and currently accessible to over 130,000 U.S. criminal justice practitioners. Purdue and NW3C have long history of successful collaboration in developing and implementing TTA programs. This extensive experience and expertise gives Purdue University the confidence that, in partnership with NW3C, it has an unparalleled ability to create and implement this national, integrated, and collaborative program.

The objective of our proposal is to reduce this cancer treatment related CV morbidity by developing, enabling, and testing a physical activity intervention that commences and continues throughout receipt of Anth-bC for the purpose of attenuating physical inactivity, preserving exercise capacity, CV & cognitive function, strength, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for those with lymphoma. The need for and the design of this program is based in part on feedback from lymphoma survivor focus groups treated in our NIH funded Comprehensive Cancer Center - preliminary pilot data (Section 3.C.1). Several novel features of this proposal include: 1) Performance of physical activity during receipt of cancer treatment where exercise intolerance originates. 2) Creation of patient communities that enable cancer patients to support one another during treatment. 3) Administration of aerobic & strength activities suited to one's individual lifestyle in the home guided by  instruction provided from 4 close to home cardiac rehabilitation facilities experienced in exercising  immunocompromised individuals and those with other pre-existing activity limitations due to cancer. 4) Utilization of newly developed magnetic resonance cardiopulmonary exercise treadmill testing methods to  measure the two components (cardiac function and peripheral factors) that contribute to peak VO2 (a  measure of maximal exercise capacity). This new information will provide mechanistic insight into how  physical activity helps preserve exercise capacity and reduce fatigue. 5) Assessment of the relationships between cognitive function, activity, and exercise capacity thereby helping  to unravel the association between physical activity, HRQOL and cognitive function in cancer patients. In this application, we propose to refine the physical activity intervention during the R21 Phase in patients who participate in the intervention for 6 months. If suitable milestones are achieved, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial in the R33 Phase to test the utility of the integrated physical activity intervention for sustaining peak V02, 6-min walk distance, cardiac and cognitive function, strength, activity, and HRQOL. If we achieve our study goals, this proposed intervention could reduce CV mortality and heart failure related hospital admissions, translate into clinical practice via extension through cardiac rehabilitation centers (often located close to cancer centers), increase health-related quality of life, reduce fatigue to perform activities of daily living, and attenuate cognitive function decline in lymphoma survivors. The results of this study could help to change existing sedentary behavior paradigms during receipt of chemotherapy and ultimately lead to improved long term outcomes for those with lymphoma and potentially other forms of cancer.",93.395: CANCER TREATMENT RESEARCH,sub-grant,CFDCBC22-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2025,1,1624-32058-11000001228,102841.00,2024-11-22,2025,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980568.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"THE VCU STUDY SITE WILL RECRUIT HALF OF THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS FOR THE R33 PHASE OF THE STUDY ~34 LYMPHOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING ACTIVE TREATMENT.

Improving OUD treatment quality in Medicaid thus can reach large numbers and inform efforts to redress inequities in care. State Medicaid programs have changed policy to expand the continuum of care, remove barriers to treatment, and improve the quality of OUD care. However, states have taken these actions amidst OUD quality measurement systems that are underdeveloped limiting opportunities for targeted intervention and robust evaluation of policy effects. Current OUD quality measures are limited in three key ways. First, OUD quality measures are seldom constructed at the provider-level, despite the fact that clinicians, practices, and facilities are the most likely locus of intervention for quality improvement programs. Second, few measures incorporate OUD patient-reported outcomes or experiences of care. Third, quality measures are typically not reported by population sub-group and thus fail to identify inequities in treatment based on race and ethnicity amenable to policy and programmatic changes. The Medicaid Outcomes Distributed Research Network (MODRN) has supported Medicaid agency efforts to improve OUD treatment by developing novel measures of treatment quality and examining effects of treatment quality on overdose. MODRN will develop Equity and QUality Improvement for Medicaid Programs (EQUIP) and draw on our robust university-state partnerships in 12 states accounting for 24% of the US Medicaid population. Our overarching goal is to develop OUD quality measures that can be constructed at the provider-level, incorporate patient experience, and center health equity. Efficient and sustainable OUD quality measures developed and implemented by MODRN-EQUIP will guide quality improvement initiatives and Medicaid policy decisions. Our goal will be achieved through three integrated research projects aiming to: 1) develop provider-level OUD quality measures using Medicaid administrative data; 2) measure OUD patient- reported outcomes and examine associations with claims-based quality measures to guide quality and equity improvement, and 3) implement and examine the effectiveness of a practice-level quality improvement intervention for OUD. A State Steering Committee of Medicaid leaders will oversee MODRN-EQUIP, drawing on infrastructure supported by prior NIDA grants (R01DA055585 and R01DA048029). These research projects will be executed by a Coordinating Center, a Methods Core and an Engagement and Dissemination Core that draws on the expertise of Medicaid beneficiaries, providers, managed care organizations and policymakers to develop quality measurement and management systems to transform substance use treatment. We will disseminate our findings through state policy networks to reach beyond our 12 states to other Medicaid programs.",93.279: DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION RESEARCH PROGRAMS; 93.279: DRUG USE AND ADDICTION RESEARCH PROGRAMS,sub-grant,D0F2A6EE-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,4,139598-4,220034.00,2024-02-05,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980568.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,IMPROVING QUALITY AND EQUITY OF OPIOID USE DISORDER TREATMENT USING A MULTI-STATE MEDICAID RESEARCH NETWORK,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_RM1DA059365_075/,2024-04-02 00:00:00+00

These infected cells could contribute to the source of residual viremia during long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) or to rebounding virus upon ART cessation. It is undoubtfully and urgently needed to develop novel strategies to specifically target CNS myeloid cells for HIV eradication and a cure. Be- cause the effects of the widely-studied “Shock and Kill” approach could exacerbate neuroinflammation, gene therapy emerges as the optimal strategy, particularly the advanced CRISPR genome editing technology. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of macaques is the best available model for testing novel strategies prior to clinical studies. We have shown that SIV infection has a broad spread in the CNS even in animals on ART. Because the virus enters the brain within a few days after infection and the establishment of the latent reservoir occurs very early, the initiation of ART should be as early as possible. In addition, numerous studies suggest that CCR5/CCR2 play a major role in HIV entry and neuroinflammation. Most importantly, we have used AAV delivery of a CRISPR/Cas genome editor to eradicate HIV/SIV provirus in models of humanized mice and non- human primates. However, the lack of AAV serotypes that are highly effective and reliable to transduce myeloid cells in the CNS remains a key challenge. Therefore, we hypothesize that the multiple-targeting gene editing system across the blood brain barrier (BBB) can remove SIV provirus in infected myeloid cells, protect cells against new infection, and inhibit neuroinflammation. To test this hypothesis, we will optimize a novel AAV sero- type with BBB penetration and myeloid-specific transduction (namely AAV-BM) to effectively deliver the smaller cjCas9 with multiplex sgRNAs (BMCj4) specific for 4 target sites (SIV LTR, gag, and host CCR5, CCR2) into the entire CNS for in vivo HIV/SIV eradication (Aim 1). We will evaluate the efficacy of BMCj4 early treatment in preventing brain SIV infection or/and excising SIV proviral DNA from brain myeloid cells in acute SIV infection with early ART (Aim 2a). We will also determine the therapeutic effect of BMCj4 with ART and then boost it with an alternative AAV-BM for eradication of persistent brain SIV latent infection (Aim 2b). We expect that early or long-term repeated BMCj4 AAV gene therapy will effectively eradicate acute and latently-infected HIV provirus and extensively minimize the size of the brain viral reservoir to achieve a sterilizing or functional cure of HIV/AIDS, particularly NeuroAIDS.",93.242: MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH GRANTS; 93.853: EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES AND NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS,sub-grant,CCAEC3CE-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2024,4,24-05010.201,816445.00,2024-03-27,2024,DXZ2Y4CF46K1,,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,,,,USA,United States,950 VA COMMONWEALTH UNIVER,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,23284,VA-04,VA-04,,,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232985008.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"THE GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ERADICATE MICROGLIA-INFECTED HIV PROVIRUSES IN THE BRAIN AND ALLEVIATE ANY RESIDUAL

Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, are critical mediators of neuroinflammation that can have either neurotoxic or neurotrophic effects. To date, these effects have been examined primarily in rodents, while their parallel consideration in humans has not yielded clinically translatable findings, suggesting potentially different responses in higher order mammals. The pig is an ideal pre-clinical translational animal model, due to its similarities to humans in cytoarchitecture, metabolic rates and systemic inflammatory responses, however, only a handful of TBI research centers are using pig models of brain injury and currently none are focused on the interaction between microglia and injured axons or pathology within the thalamic domain. Our preliminary data demonstrated that microglial processes converge onto injured axonal swellings (microglial process convergence; MPC) in the thalamus of micro pigs, that is not recapitulated in rats, following diffuse TBI. Increased sensitivity to sensory stimulation and anxiety are associated with TBI and inflammation, unfortunately, the limited use of behavioral assessments in pig models of TBI leaves the link between post-injury MPC and behavioral outcomes unclear. Both our preliminary data and previous studies indicate that MPC may be an ameliorative process, promoting axonal outgrowth post-injury with the caveat that aberrant axonal outgrowth is linked to heightened behavioral morbidity. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the role of MPC on neurite outgrowth and behavioral morbidity in a pig model of diffuse TBI and gain insight into the similarity to human pathology. Studies indicate that males have greater pro-inflammatory responses, less axonal outgrowth, and reduced sensory sensitivity and anxiety compared to females. However, there are no known studies evaluating MPC in both males and females. Accordingly, the current study will address the following specific aim 1) To elucidate the extent and role of microglial process convergence on axonal outgrowth and behavioral morbidity following diffuse TBI. To address this aim we will complete quantitative 3D assessments of multiplexed immunohistological samples for microglial-axonal interactions/MPC in pigs to determine the degree and progression of MPC in relation to sensory sensitivity and anxiety/social interaction changes, axonal outgrowth/retraction changes in both sexes within the first week post-injury. This study is significant because it will provide valuable preliminary data regarding 1) the duration and extent of MPC in a gyrencephalic pig model, 2) the behavioral dysfunction(s) associated with thalamic MPC, and 3) the sex-associated differences in MPC. These studies will serve as a springboard for future investigations into 1) the potential adaptive and/or maladaptive role of various degrees of MPC 2) the molecular mechanisms involved in and potential therapeutic modulation of MPC and 3) investigations regarding the therapeutic modulation of TBI-mediated sensory sensitivity and/or anxiety.",93.853: EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES AND NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS,sub-grant,CEF54D56-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2025,2,FP00017435_SA002,4482.99,2025-01-15,2025,CLC6REB58U73,785883331,RICHMOND INSTITUTE FOR VETERANS RESEARCH,,,,,USA,United States,1201 BROAD ROCK BLVD,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232490001,VA-03,VA-04,,NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232490001,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,BEHAVIORAL AND AXONAL IMPACTS OF THALAMIC MICROGLIAL PROCESS CONVERGENCE FOLLOWING DIFFUSE BRAIN INJURY,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R21NS126611_075/,2025-02-28 00:00:00+00

Virginia is making great progress addressing coverage disparities and inequities. The state recently expanded FAMIS/Medicaid (F/M) eligibility (coverage of undocumented pregnant people, extension of post-partum coverage from 60 days to 12 months, elimination of the 40 Quarter Rule) and added dental services for adults. Combined with Medicaid expansion, effective January 1, 2019, now is the best of times for the nearly 2 million Virginians who rely on this important coverage.      The end of the PHE threatens much of the enrollment progress achieved since 2019. Significant disenrollment, added to the large numbers of eligible children, parents and pregnant people not yet covered, would quickly become the worst of times for these families. The Virginia Health Care Foundation (VHCF) will use HEALTHY KIDS 2022 (HK) funds ($1,486,611 over 3 years) and its seasoned, productive Application Assisters (AAs) to prevent inappropriate coverage loss (particularly for African-American, Hispanic and other Virginians of color, likely to be disproportionately disenrolled), preserve the progress Virginia has made in the last 3 years, and enroll more of those eligible, but uncovered. 	HK-funded AAs will work in 9 of the Virginia localities with the highest numbers of uninsured F/M-income-eligible children (Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, Henrico, Loudoun, Prince William, Norfolk, Richmond City, Virginia Beach). Together, they are home to 43% of the state’s F/M income-eligible, uninsured children (18,236) (US Census, Small Area Health Insurance Estimates, 2019) and thousands of income-eligible parents and pregnant people. AAs will provide 1:1 application assistance to enroll or renew F/M coverage for 5,832 Virginians during the 3-year CA period.      F/M outreach and enrollment (O&E) aligns perfectly with VHCF’s mission to increase access to primary health care for uninsured and medically-underserved Virginians. Maximizing the number enrolled in state-sponsored health insurance is a core goal in VHCF’s Strategic Plan. The Foundation has led Virginia’s private sector F/M O&E for 23 years, and has developed substantial O&E experience and a deep knowledge-base. VHCF has trained, supported and coached more than 200 AAs since 1999, who have enrolled/retained more than 128,500 Virginians (mostly children and pregnant people).      VHCF will maximize enrollment and retention of eligible children, parents and pregnant persons in F/M with a 2-generation approach, helping household members of all ages apply for or renew coverage. AAs will use both best practices and innovative strategies, engage in effective partnerships, and monitor results to achieve goals. Clear, consistent messaging throughout the year regarding F/M (value, eligibility criteria, benefits, application/renewal process, #Enroll365) and free, 1:1 application assistance, virtual and in-person, will be used.      Virginia has made exciting progress expanding eligibility and services in F/M since 2019, attracting more enrollees and playing an important role in bridging racial and demographic health coverage disparities. VHCF aims to maximize enrollment/renewals through 1:1 application assistance and ensuring local partners/stakeholders are prepared for the coming tsunami of renewals. HK funds will continue the work of experienced, valued and productive AAs in communities with high numbers of potentially-eligible children, parents and pregnant people; their focus will be on those with lower education levels, those who do not speak English well and/or are at disproportionate risk of being inappropriately disenrolled from F/M.",93.767: CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM,sub-grant,6397446E-FCCD-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2023,11,HK2204,12780.00,2023-11-15,2024,ENKXBKBQ1EM4,829184618,COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA-STATE BOARD OF HEALTH,,,,,USA,United States,400 E CARY ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232193816,VA-04,VA-04,,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232193816,VA-04,VA-04,USA,United States,"RICHMOND CITY HEALTH DISTRICT (RCHD) WILL TARGET ITS MATERNITY NAVIGATION PROGRAM (SERVING MOSTLY PREGNANT HISPANIC PERSONS), WIC AND FAMILY PLANNING CLIENTS, AND PUBLIC HOUSING RESIDENTS VIA ITS RCHD STAFFED HEALTH RESOURCE CENTERS.

CHIARI TYPE 1 MALFORMATION (CM) IS A COMMON AND POTENTIALLY DEBILITATING DISEASE TYPICALLY DEFINED BY CAUDAL
DISPLACEMENT OF THE CEREBELLAR TONSILS BELOW THE FORAMEN MAGNUM. WHILE RADIOGRAPHIC CM MAY BE FOUND IN 1%
OR MORE OF THE POPULATION, THIS POPULATION IS EXTREMELY HETEROGENEOUS. PATIENTS WITH CLASSICALLY DEFINED CM MAY BE CLINICALLY ASYMPTOMATIC OR PRESENT WITH SEVERE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS DEBILITATING HEADACHES OR SIGNS OF BRAINSTEM OR SPINAL CORD MALFUNCTION. FURTHERMORE, PATIENTS WITH SIMILAR CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS MAY HAVE DISTINCT GENETIC PROFILES AND COMORBID DIAGNOSES THAT SUGGEST DIFFERING ETIOLOGIES CONTRIBUTING TO SUPERFICIALLY SIMILAR DISEASE. INCREASING RECOGNITION OF THIS HETEROGENEITY HAS EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR A DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH TO

GENOMICS, AND PATIENT-CENTERED CLINICAL MEASURES HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY EXPANDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR PHENOTYPING
COMPLEX DISEASES, SUCH AS CM. LEVERAGING WASHINGTON UNIVERSITYÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã¢Â€ŽÂ¢S UNIQUE STRENGTHS IN THESE AREAS, THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT 4 IS TO DERIVE CLINICALLY RELEVANT, MULTIDIMENSIONAL ENDOPHENOTYPES WITHIN TRADITIONALLYDEFINED ÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã…Â€ŒCMÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½ TO INFORM CLINICAL MANAGEMENT AND OPTIMIZE LONG-TERM PATIENT OUTCOMES. IN PARTICULAR, WE EXPECT THESE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ENDOPHENOTYPES WILL BOTH AID IN OUTCOME PREDICTION AND ALSO PROVIDE NEW BIOLOGICAL INSIGHTS REGARDING DISEASE PATHOGENESIS, THEREBY SUPPORTING PERSONALIZED TREATMENT STRATEGIES. WE INTEND TO PURSUE THIS OBJECTIVE THROUGH THREE SPECIFIC AIMS. IN AIM 1, WE WILL APPLY WELL-ESTABLISHED UNSUPERVISED AND SEMISUPERVISED CLUSTERING METHODS TO MULTIDIMENSIONAL CLINICAL AND RADIOLOGICAL DATA TO DERIVE NOVEL CLUSTERS IN A LARGE, MULTICENTER DATASET. WE WILL THEN EXTERNALLY VALIDATE THOSE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ENDOPHENOTYPES IN THREE EXTERNAL, MULTICENTER DATASETS. IN AIM 2 WE WILL COMPARE DIFFERENCES IN DISEASE PRESENTATION ACROSS CLUSTERS AND ALSO USE STATE-OF-THE-ART GENETICS AND ADVANCED IMAGING TECHNIQUES TO OBTAIN NEW INSIGHTS INTO BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES UNDERLYING CM HETEROGENEITY AND PATHOGENESIS.

This definition oversimplifies the complex range of craniovertebral junction pathology affecting more than 1% of the population and has little relevance to the neurological effects of CM. However, current clinical practice continues to rely heavily on this oversimplified and outdated definition of CM, with most management decisions based on a single, static 2D sagittal MRI image, failing to consider the dynamic pathophysiology at the interface of the cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. Investigations from our group and others implicate a hyperdynamic pathophysiological state in CM, with turbulent CSF flow patterns, exaggerated pulsatile motion of the tonsils and brainstem, and dysfunction or injury to the cerebellum, brainstem, or spinal cord. The relationship of these changes at the CVJ to patient experience (pain and/or neurological deficits), cognitive or behavioral outcome, and CM-associated syringomyelia (SM, spinal cord cavitation), remains unclear and under-investigated. The Park-Reeves Chiari & Syringomyelia Center (PRCSC) at Washington University was established in 2011 and has become the international leader and vibrant focal point for research into CM. The Overarching Theme of this PRCSC Program Project Proposal is “Redefining Chiari Type I Malformation and its Impact on Neurological Outcome.” This proposal will leverage key strengths and scientific advances at Washington University to investigate the largest and most refined cohort of CM patients in the world. Four Cores [Administrative (AC), Clinical (CC), Genetic (GC), and Radiology (RC) Cores] will support 4 Projects: Genetic Underpinnings of CM and Effect on Brain Development [Haller, Project Lead (PL); Solnica-Krezel, Co-Lead (CL)]; Functional Connectivity, Brain Development, and Outcomes in CM [Dosenbach, PL; Roland and Marek, CL]; CSF-Mediated Pathophysiology and Microstructural Injury Determines Outcomes in CM [Strahle, PL; Song, CL]; and Redefining CM Using Genotype-Phenotype Relationships and Impact on Outcome [Limbrick, PL; Greenberg and Lu, CL]. Although these Cores and Projects each address unique Specific Aims, they will generate a wealth of multidimensional data from PRCSC participants to permit a cohesive, synergistic, and comprehensive examination of the overarching Aims of this application. Indeed, PRCSC as a whole is much greater than the sum of its Cores and Projects.  Overall Specific Aim 1. Determine the genetic factors contributing to CM, brain development, and  neurological function.  Overall Specific Aim 2. Determine the pathophysiological basis for CM-related neurological effects.

CHIARI TYPE 1 MALFORMATION (CM) IS A COMMON AND POTENTIALLY DEBILITATING DISEASE TYPICALLY DEFINED BY CAUDAL
DISPLACEMENT OF THE CEREBELLAR TONSILS BELOW THE FORAMEN MAGNUM. WHILE RADIOGRAPHIC CM MAY BE FOUND IN 1%
OR MORE OF THE POPULATION, THIS POPULATION IS EXTREMELY HETEROGENEOUS. PATIENTS WITH CLASSICALLY DEFINED CM MAY BE CLINICALLY ASYMPTOMATIC OR PRESENT WITH SEVERE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS DEBILITATING HEADACHES OR SIGNS OF BRAINSTEM OR SPINAL CORD MALFUNCTION. FURTHERMORE, PATIENTS WITH SIMILAR CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS MAY HAVE DISTINCT GENETIC PROFILES AND COMORBID DIAGNOSES THAT SUGGEST DIFFERING ETIOLOGIES CONTRIBUTING TO SUPERFICIALLY SIMILAR DISEASE.

WE INTEND TO PURSUE THIS OBJECTIVE THROUGH THREE SPECIFIC AIMS. IN AIM 1, WE WILL APPLY WELL-ESTABLISHED UNSUPERVISED AND SEMISUPERVISED CLUSTERING METHODS TO MULTIDIMENSIONAL CLINICAL AND RADIOLOGICAL DATA TO DERIVE NOVEL CLUSTERS IN A LARGE, MULTICENTER DATASET. WE WILL THEN EXTERNALLY VALIDATE THOSE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ENDOPHENOTYPES IN THREE EXTERNAL, MULTICENTER DATASETS. IN AIM 2 WE WILL COMPARE DIFFERENCES IN DISEASE PRESENTATION ACROSS CLUSTERS AND ALSO USE STATE-OF-THE-ART GENETICS AND ADVANCED IMAGING TECHNIQUES TO OBTAIN NEW INSIGHTS INTO BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES UNDERLYING CM HETEROGENEITY AND PATHOGENESIS. IN AIM 3 WE WILL EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THESE CLUSTERS AND IMPORTANT CM OUTCOMES (E.G., CHANGE IN QUALITY OF LIFE, POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS).

This definition oversimplifies the complex range of craniovertebral junction pathology affecting more than 1% of the population and has little relevance to the neurological effects of CM. However, current clinical practice continues to rely heavily on this oversimplified and outdated definition of CM, with most management decisions based on a single, static 2D sagittal MRI image, failing to consider the dynamic pathophysiology at the interface of the cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. Investigations from our group and others implicate a hyperdynamic pathophysiological state in CM, with turbulent CSF flow patterns, exaggerated pulsatile motion of the tonsils and brainstem, and dysfunction or injury to the cerebellum, brainstem, or spinal cord. The relationship of these changes at the CVJ to patient experience (pain and/or neurological deficits), cognitive or behavioral outcome, and CM-associated syringomyelia (SM, spinal cord cavitation), remains unclear and under-investigated. The Park-Reeves Chiari & Syringomyelia Center (PRCSC) at Washington University was established in 2011 and has become the international leader and vibrant focal point for research into CM. The Overarching Theme of this PRCSC Program Project Proposal is “Redefining Chiari Type I Malformation and its Impact on Neurological Outcome.” This proposal will leverage key strengths and scientific advances at Washington University to investigate the largest and most refined cohort of CM patients in the world. Four Cores [Administrative (AC), Clinical (CC), Genetic (GC), and Radiology (RC) Cores] will support 4 Projects: Genetic Underpinnings of CM and Effect on Brain Development [Haller, Project Lead (PL); Solnica-Krezel, Co-Lead (CL)]; Functional Connectivity, Brain Development, and Outcomes in CM [Dosenbach, PL; Roland and Marek, CL]; CSF-Mediated Pathophysiology and Microstructural Injury Determines Outcomes in CM [Strahle, PL; Song, CL]; and Redefining CM Using Genotype-Phenotype Relationships and Impact on Outcome [Limbrick, PL; Greenberg and Lu, CL]. Although these Cores and Projects each address unique Specific Aims, they will generate a wealth of multidimensional data from PRCSC participants to permit a cohesive, synergistic, and comprehensive examination of the overarching Aims of this application. Indeed, PRCSC as a whole is much greater than the sum of its Cores and Projects.  Overall Specific Aim 1. Determine the genetic factors contributing to CM, brain development, and  neurological function.  Overall Specific Aim 2. Determine the pathophysiological basis for CM-related neurological effects.  Overall Specific Aim 3: Create a novel CM framework to enhance treatment response and outcomes.",93.853: EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES AND NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS,sub-grant,BAA9CDE0-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2025,1,WU-25-0327,48126.00,2024-12-17,2025,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,WXQLZ1PA6XP3,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232980568.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,"1P01NS131131-01 - REDEFINING CHIARI TYPE I MALFORMATION (CM) AND SYRINGOMYELIA (SM) AND IMPACT ON NEUROLOGICAL OUTCOMES (PROJECT 4)

SCOPE OF WORK
PROJECT 4: REDEFINING CM USING MULTIDIMENSIONAL ENDOPHENOTYPES PREDICTIVE OF LONG-TERM OUTCOME
CHIARI TYPE 1 MALFORMATION (CM) IS A COMMON AND POTENTIALLY DEBILITATING DISEASE TYPICALLY DEFINED BY CAUDAL
DISPLACEMENT OF THE CEREBELLAR TONSILS BELOW THE FORAMEN MAGNUM. WHILE RADIOGRAPHIC CM MAY BE FOUND IN 1%
OR MORE OF THE POPULATION, THIS POPULATION IS EXTREMELY HETEROGENEOUS. PATIENTS WITH CLASSICALLY DEFINED CM
MAY BE CLINICALLY ASYMPTOMATIC OR PRESENT WITH SEVERE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS DEBILITATING HEADACHES OR SIGNS OF
BRAINSTEM OR SPINAL CORD MALFUNCTION. FURTHERMORE, PATIENTS WITH SIMILAR CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS MAY HAVE DISTINCT
GENETIC PROFILES AND COMORBID DIAGNOSES THAT SUGGEST DIFFERING ETIOLOGIES CONTRIBUTING TO SUPERFICIALLY SIMILAR
DISEASE. INCREASING RECOGNITION OF THIS HETEROGENEITY HAS EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR A DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH TO
RECLASSIFYING TRADITIONALLY-DEFINED ÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã…Â€ŒCM.ÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½ FURTHERMORE, ADVANCES IN CONTEMPORARY METHODS IN IMAGING,
GENOMICS, AND PATIENT-CENTERED CLINICAL MEASURES HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY EXPANDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR PHENOTYPING
COMPLEX DISEASES, SUCH AS CM. LEVERAGING WASHINGTON UNIVERSITYÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã¢Â€ŽÂ¢S UNIQUE STRENGTHS IN THESE AREAS, THE
OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT 4 IS TO DERIVE CLINICALLY RELEVANT, MULTIDIMENSIONAL ENDOPHENOTYPES WITHIN
TRADITIONALLY DEFINED ÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã…Â€ŒCMÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã¯Â¿Â½ TO INFORM CLINICAL MANAGEMENT AND OPTIMIZE LONG-TERM PATIENT OUTCOMES. IN PARTICULAR,
WE EXPECT THESE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ENDOPHENOTYPES WILL BOTH AID IN OUTCOME PREDICTION AND ALSO PROVIDE NEW
BIOLOGICAL INSIGHTS REGARDING DISEASE PATHOGENESIS, THEREBY SUPPORTING PERSONALIZED TREATMENT STRATEGIES. WE
INTEND TO PURSUE THIS OBJECTIVE THROUGH THREE SPECIFIC AIMS. IN AIM 1, WE WILL APPLY WELL-ESTABLISHED
UNSUPERVISED AND SEMI-SUPERVISED CLUSTERING METHODS TO MULTIDIMENSIONAL CLINICAL AND RADIOLOGICAL DATA TO
DERIVE NOVEL CLUSTERS IN A LARGE, MULTICENTER DATASET. WE WILL THEN EXTERNALLY VALIDATE THOSE MULTIDIMENSIONAL
ENDOPHENOTYPES IN THREE EXTERNAL, MULTICENTER DATASETS. IN AIM 2 WE WILL COMPARE DIFFERENCES IN DISEASE
PRESENTATION ACROSS CLUSTERS AND ALSO USE STATE-OF-THE-ART GENETICS AND ADVANCED IMAGING TECHNIQUES TO OBTAIN
NEW INSIGHTS INTO BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES UNDERLYING CM HETEROGENEITY AND PATHOGENESIS. IN AIM 3 WE WILL
EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THESE CLUSTERS AND IMPORTANT CM OUTCOMES (E.G., CHANGE IN QUALITY OF LIFE,
POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS). WE WILL THEN USE PREDICTION MODELING TO EXAMINE HOW BOTH CLUSTER IDENTITY AND
OTHER CHARACTERISTICS IMPACT THESE OUTCOMES. FINALLY, WE WILL USE A MODIFIED DELPHI APPROACH TO CREATE A NOVEL
TREATMENT FRAMEWORK BASED ON THIS PROJECTÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã¢Â€ŽÂ¢S FINDINGS ALONG WITH STRUCTURED FEEDBACK FROM EXPERTS IN THE
RESEARCH AND CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF CM. TAKEN TOGETHER, THIS PROJECTÃƑÂ¢Ã¢Â€ŠÂ¬Ã¢Â€ŽÂ¢S RESULTS WILL OFFER A FUNDAMENTALLY NEW
DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH FOR CLASSIFYING CM. WE EXPECT THESE FINDINGS WILL HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON CLINICAL
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND WILL GUIDE FUTURE RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD.

PROJECT 4 WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS:
AIM 1: IDENTIFY NOVEL MULTIDIMENSIONAL ENDOPHENOTYPES FOR CM.
AIM 2: COMPARE DIFFERENCES IN DISEASE PRESENTATION AND PATHOGENESIS ACROSS THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL
ENDOPHENOTYPES
AIM 3: USE NOVEL CM MULTIDIMENSIONAL ENDOPHENOTYPES, PREDICTION MODELING, AND EXPERT OPINION TO
CREATE A NEW TREATMENT FRAMEWORK.

AS PROJECT 4 LEAD, DR. LIMBRICK WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSIMILATING THE DATA COLLECTED OVER THE ENTIRETY OF THE
P01. HE WILL UNITE THE OTHER INVESTIGATORS IN PROJECT 4, EACH WITH THEIR OWN EXPERTISE (GENETICS, RADIOGENOMICS,
NEUROSURGERY, DATA MODELING) AS THEY WORK TOGETHER TO MEET THE AIMS. DR. LIMBRICK WILL OVERSEE THE CONDUCT OF
ALL STUDY ACTIVITIES. HE WILL HOST REGULAR MEETINGS TO DISCUSS PRELIMINARY DATA ANALYSIS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF
THIS PROJECTS AIMS. AS VCU LEAD OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE CORE AND CLINICAL CORE DR. LIMBRICK WILL BE APPRISED OF THE PROGRESS OF THE OTHER TEAMS AND AN EFFECTIVE LIAISON ACROSS ALL PROJECTS AND CORES. HE WILL ASSIST IN EVALUATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS. DR. LIMBRICK WILL WORK WITH DRS. MIAN, HALLER, LU AND GREENBERG TO WRITE

NRSA-Training-001 (883) NRSA TRAINING CORE ABSTRACT The Integrated Virginia Research Training Centers in Kidney, Urology and Hematology (IGNITE KUH) training program is being proposed to address an unmet need and major gap in prioritized research training through development and integration of a statewide research program in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The IGNITE KUH NRSA Training Core is an innovative and distinctive multi-institutional, multi-departmental program comprising a team of 65 outstanding faculty from the University of Virginia (UVA), Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT) with primary research programs anchored in the basic research and clinical science of benign KUH diseases in six thematic areas: Systems Biology and Functional Genomics, Immunity and Inflammation, Biomedical Engineering, Nanotherapeutics and Drug Discovery, Clinical and Data Sciences, and Predictive Analytics. The NRSA Training Core leverages existing strengths in kidney and hematological disease research, uniting them with urological disease research in a cohesive, integrated and coordinated research training program. The NRSA Training Core will be enhanced through participation and integration of the Translational Health Research Institute of Virginia (iTHRIV), a component of the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) partnership between UVA and VT, and the Wright Center for Clinical and Translational Research (CCTR) at VCU. Three major goals of the IGNITE KUH NRSA Training Core include: 1) increase training of PhD students, residents (urology) and postdoctoral fellows in basic and translational aspects of KUH in health and disease using a unified approach; 2) establish an integrated Virginia-wide research training program focused on KUH-diseases; and 3) attract outstanding students and postdoctoral fellows with long-term career interests in basic or clinical research into the IGNITE KUH Training Program. IGNITE KUH will prioritize strategies to attract students from underrepresented populations at several partner institutions, including three historically black universities in Virginia – Virginia State University (VSU), Hampton University (HU), and Virginia Union Universities (VUU) – thereby further enhancing development and training of both PhD researchers and physician scientists. The IGNITE KUH NRSA Training Core will address human health issues through increased education and training of the next generation of researchers and physician scientists in basic research or clinical science who can guide and lead future research programs aiming to lessen human disease and suffering in KUH-specific fields.

While immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has benefited some patients, most melanoma patients do not respond to ICB. This is largely due to a lack of preexisting target cells and checkpoints for ICB, tumor antigenic heterogeneity, and tumor immunosuppression. ICB therapeutic efficacy can be promoted by vaccine formulations that deliver tumor antigens to induce new antitumor cells for ICB to target and reduce tumor immunosuppression. Chemically defined peptide vaccines are attractive for relatively easy manufacturing and good pharmaceutical stability. The success of peptide vaccines relies on efficient delivery. Despite clinical testing of various peptide vaccine formulations, their therapeutic efficacy has been limited due to delivery and immunomodulation issues including 1) poor vaccine delivery to the sites of action (lymph nodes and antigen-presenting cells), 2) poor immunostimulant adjuvant efficacy due to restricted target cell subsets in human, 3) limited adjuvant/antigen codelivery to enhance antigen immunogenicity, 4) limited ability to overcome tumor antigenic heterogeneity, and 5) limited ability to deliver heterogeneous antigens. Our strategy is to develop a high efficiency and spatiotemporally targeted peptide vaccine platform that addresses each of these deficiencies to improve ICB therapy: 1) albumin hitchhiking delivers peptide vaccines to lymph nodes and antigen-presenting cells, 2) a di-adjuvant targets a broad spectrum of cell subsets across species, 3) potent di-adjuvant and adjuvant/antigen codelivery enhance antigen immunogenicity, and 4) a modular system delivers heterogeneous multi-antigens to overcome tumor antigenic heterogeneity. In our preliminary studies, we developed albumin-binding vaccines (AlbiVax) to enhance vaccine delivery 100-fold in mice, promote anticancer T cell responses 14-fold, and improve melanoma therapeutic efficacy relative to a clinical benchmark. Moreover, by codelivering a di-adjuvant and antigens using a nanoscaffold, AlbiVax further potentiated antigen immunogenicity and promoted melanoma therapeutic efficacy. Our objective in this study is to engineer multi-antigen/di-adjuvant codelivery AlbiVax (mADC-AlbiVax) as an efficient platform that codelivers a di-adjuvant and multiple heterogenous peptide antigens to lymph nodes and antigen-presenting cells to elicit a potent, broad, and long-lasting immunity for ICB melanoma combination immunotherapy. Aim 1 is to optimize the modular structure of model mADC-AlbiVax for targeted multi-antigen/di-adjuvant codelivery to lymph nodes, antigen-presenting cells, and subcellular locations for optimal antitumor immunomodulation; Aim 2 is to synthesize melanoma mADC-AlbiVax using multiple tumor antigens and measure vaccine codelivery and immunomodulation; Aim 3 is to evaluate the melanoma therapeutic efficacy and safety of melanoma mADC- AlbiVax combined with ICB in multiple mouse models. A significant deliverable of this work will be preclinical validation of an innovative system to codeliver chemically-defined vaccines using clinically tested or used agents for future clinical evaluation. 1",93.395: CANCER TREATMENT RESEARCH,sub-grant,C52ABE3C-FCD1-11EF-AB59-07ECA35F602B,2023,11,SUBK00020266,54030.00,2023-11-13,2024,MLQFL4JSSAA9,105300446,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,,,,,USA,United States,910 WEST FRANKLIN ST,RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232849005,VA-03,VA-04,,"MINORITY INSTITUTION,U.S. STATE GOVERNMENT,EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING",RICHMOND,VA,VIRGINIA,232985008.0,VA-03,VA-04,USA,United States,TO WORK WITH THE PI OF THIS PROJECT TO DEVELOP AND TEST NOVEL IMMUNOTHERAPY FOR MELANOMA.,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R01CA266981_075/,2023-11-13 00:00:00+00
